The Bush administration yesterday named South Korea, West Germany and Japan as countries that need to do more to reduce the huge trade surpluses they are running with the United States.The administration's assessment, delivered by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and undersecretary-designate David Mulford, was particularly critical of West Germany and South Korea.The officials, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, indicated that those two countries need significant changes in their domestic economic policies to promote reductions in global trade imbalances.Mulford said pointedly that discussions with South Korean officials had at times been ""quite frustrating."" While some progress has been made in getting the government to allow its currency to strengthen in relation to the U.S. dollar, Mulford said more needed to be done in this area to make U.S. goods cheaper in Korea.Earlier this week, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho met with administration officials in Washington to discuss trade.

5,"As Price at Pump Falls, Drivers Filled With Joy; Gasoline Is Better Bargain Now Than in '60s. Southern Californians seem happier than ever these days, and it has nothing to do with the bright sunshine that has replaced this winter's miserable rains. It is even more important than that: They can fill their beloved cars with gasoline for under $1 a gallon.The same is true across the country, including the Washington area, where motorists are pulling up to the pumps and happily rediscovering the good old days as the price of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, is selling for less than the long-forgotten 25 cents a gallon it used to fetch in the early 1960s.But here in the biggest gasoline market in the nation, with notoriously long commutes over a vast freeway network, cheaper gasoline is particularly good news. ""I haven't seen these prices since cigarettes were 98 cents a pack,"" exulted Marcus Ware. Ware, 30, commutes 150 miles a day round trip from the inland desert suburb of Lancaster to his job at a credit card company here. He figures the weekly gasoline bill for his two cars has dropped from $150 to $85.Coley Sohn, a 28-year-old professional dog walker from Venice, said: ""My friends make fun of me, but I really get excited when I see 91 cents a gallon. I feel like I have to pull over and fill up. I'm very superstitious, so I feel like if the gas prices are good, then everything will be good.""And Nels Israelson, 39, an ecologically conscious photographer who regularly escapes to his cabin near Mount Baldy, in San Bernardino County, was filling up his mud-splattered Land Rover while complaining what lower gasoline prices might mean for the environment.",0,1.0,0.0,3932
6,"Four Golden Years And Going for More. Bucking dire predictions about the effects of impeachment, declining earnings and sky-high price-to-earnings ratios, the stock market has risen for the past six sessions in a row and could return more than 30 percent in 1999. In fact, the four years that come to a close this Thursday may be the best in history.Throughout this bull market, naysayers have fretted about lofty valuations, but stocks have simply climbed higher. Today, for example, the P/E ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the best proxy for the broad market, is an astronomical 32, compared with an average of 19 over the past 12 years.Could it be that prominent pessimists -- such as Robert Shiller of Yale and John Campbell of Harvard, who said two years ago (with the Dow at 6382) that stocks were at unsustainable heights, and the Economist magazine, which seems almost to be cheering for a crash -- are drawing conclusions from an antiquated model of the market? It seems so.With a colleague, economist Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, I have been working for the past year on a book that offers an explanation for the fabulous returns of recent years. We argue that stocks are moving now to correct a state of perennial undervaluation and that this strong upward trend will continue.Our analysis is pretty technical, but it begins with a fact that economists have known for years: Over the long term, stocks are no more risky than bonds. Stocks and bonds should logically provide roughly the same returns, but stocks return far more -- an average of 11 percent a year, compared with just 5 percent for bonds.",0,0.6687,0.33130000000000004,2875

8,"Jobs Data Provide Hope --- Market Rallies on Private-Sector Gains, Even as Unemployment Rate Ticks Up. The U.S. economy lost jobs for the third month in a row in August, but modest hiring by the private sector eased concerns the economy might be tumbling back into recession.Private-sector employers added 67,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said Friday. Overall, nonfarm payrolls fell by 54,000, as the U.S. shed 114,000 temporary Census workers and state governments also reduced employment.The jobs report was consistent with other recent economic reports, including a strong factory report earlier this week, that show the economy continues to recover, though at a painfully slow rate.The unemployment rate ticked up to 9.6% from 9.5% in July, not because of layoffs but because more people entered the work force. Some 14.9 million people remain jobless, and the unemployment figure marked the 16th straight month above 9%, the longest stretch in a quarter-century.That promised to keep the pressure on Democrats in Congress as midterm elections approach, with Republicans pressing the case that the party that dominates both Congress and the White House isn't getting Americans back to work.",0,1.0,0.0,4326

After weeks of sitting on the sidelines, European central banks intervened in foreign exchange markets Friday to slow the dollar's decline.Now, traders and economists are trying to figure out what kind of message the central banks were attempting to send. And they're still asking themselves: Where's the U.S. Federal Reserve?Suspicion is growing that major central banks are resigned to a continuing decline of the dollar but are reluctant to acknowledge it. Their major task now, in the view of several analysts, is to see that the U.S. currency's retreat stays orderly.""Without some sign of a really determined, concerted effort to hold it, (the dollar) is going to go to new lows,"" the head of foreign exchange operations for a major U.S. bank said. ""The Bank of Japan must accept the inevitability of a stronger yen. The Fed's interest . . . is just to make sure (the dollar) doesn't drop so fast that nobody buys their bonds.""Friday, the Bank of Japan sold yen to buy dollars in Tokyo trading, as it had been doing all week.

11,"Integrity in Numbers. Federal statistics are the guide by which the government',steers the massive economic and social policies that touch the^lives of us all. These statistics are very sensitive. The monthly reports on inflation, for example, are calculated in tenths of a percentage point. A few tenths of a point, up or down, are a disaster or a triumph for the administration. A few more tenths of a point can turn an election.Professional scholars and analysts have been expressing rising concern over political pressures on the agencies that gather and compute these crucial figures. Their concern rose sharply this spring when the administration picked men from President NixonUas re-election campaign operations to head two of the most prestigious statistical agencies. Last Tuesday we denounced these appointments, and this morning we publish a letter in reply from Paul R. Squires, the associate director of one of those agencies, the Census Bureau. Mr. Squires correctly points out a factual error in our editorial Tuesday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is, of course, in the Department of Labor and not. as we erroneously said, in the Department of Commerce. Otherwise, unfortunately, our comments on Tuesday were accurate. If anything, we have come to this issue a bit late.Last December, the Industrial Relations Research Association published a resolution declaring that UIthe credibility of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been impaired by events of the last two years.U Those events had just culminated in the White HouseUas decision to fire the highly qualified head of the Bureau, Dr. Geoffrey Moore. Five months later, the job still has not been filled.The American Statistical Association and the Federal Statistics UsersUa Conference set up a point Committee on the Integrity of Federal Statistics that, after a yearUas study, brought out its report in February. UIThe causes for concern which led to the formation of this committee have been intensified during the past year,U it declared. It spoke of UIpremature retirements of key professional personnel,U and a reorganization pattern that UIprovides increasing opportunities to exert political influence on the development and interpretation of statistical programs.UWhat could political pressure accomplish? Certainly nothing so obvious as falsified figures. But this committee report offers an illustration of the danger. Suppose that an automobile manufacturer adds pollution control equipment to its cars and raises the price. Does the price increase represent an improvement in the quality of the car? All of the price .increase? Part of it? If it is counted as a quality improvement, then it shows up in the statistics as growth in real economic production, wealth, and manpower productivity. If it is counted as a cost increase, it shows up as more inflation. In that case, it could trigger cost-Qf-living raises for millions of workers, and strengthen the political criticism of the administrationUas economic strategy;",0,0.6593,0.3407,1290
12,"Union Leaders Again Reach for COLA --- Inflation Boosts Cost-of-Living Adjustments' Allure. COLA is creeping back.The percentage of unionized workers covered by cost-of-living-adjustment clauses, which had declined in recent years, is rising again as inflation heats up. What's more, many observers expect that this year's higher inflation rate will move COLA clauses back onto the bargaining table. And existing COLA clauses are starting to be worth more in labor contracts.""Generally, if the Consumer Price Index is going up, it will be a topic in more and more settlements. Workers would like some compensation in addition to wages,"" says Fehmida Sleemi, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Higher inflation also means bigger COLA payouts, especially in cases where payouts begin only after inflation hits a certain level. Last year, payouts under cost-of-living clauses made up 26% of overall union wage increases, compared with 16% of such payouts in 1987. This year, that figure is likely to rise.Over the past three years, a typical COLA clause that provided for a one-cent-an-hour increase for every 0.3% increase in the CPI would have yielded a total of $1.05 an hour. Over the next three years, assuming that inflation rises an average of 4.8% a year, that same COLA clause would yield $1.76 an hour. The calculations are based on changes in the CPI, which uses 1967 as a base of 100. That figure stood at 354.3 at the end of 1988.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004,812

Wall Street extended its fourth-quarter rally into a second day Monday, supported by falling oil prices and a bullish assessment of the economy from a Federal Reserve official.Investors were cheered by a dip in oil prices, which backed off the $50-per-barrel mark of Friday's close of trading. A barrel of light crude closed at $49.91, down 21 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Stocks received a boost before the session opened when Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Anthony M. Santomero said in a speech that he expected the economy to grow by 3.5 percent to 4 percent through 2005.

14,"International ETFs Surge in Popularity After Strong Returns. Investor interest in international funds has tempered slightly, but that hasn't altered the picture for international ETFs. Over the past year, these funds have become huge.Exchange-traded funds, index-tracking mutual funds which trade on an exchange like a stock, have been raking in cash -- and internationally oriented ETFs have grown even faster than their domestic counterparts.According to the Investment Company Institute, total ETF assets rose 38% to $335.1 billion in the past 12 months. In the same time, global ETFs nearly doubled to $82.8 billion. (The funds reached their peak of $88.9 billion in April, before emerging markets slumped.)Both mutual funds and ETFs are popular with investors seeking to put money abroad because differences of language, currency and reporting all make picking individual stocks tricky. Many financial advisers say investors should have some portion, often as much as 20%, of their savings invested in foreign companies. Because foreign stocks tend to rise and fall at different times than U.S. stocks, overseas exposure can even out stock-market swings.Of course, the fact that international funds have posted strong returns over the past several years hasn't hurt their popularity either. ""Investors gravitate to markets that perform well,"" says J.D. Steinhilber, founder of AgileInvesting.com, an investment-advisory service.

Estimates of the federal budget savings due to an assumed 0.8 percentage point decline in interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were misstated in a Business article yesterday. Such a reduction would reduce the deficit by about $12.5 billion in fiscal 1997 and a cumulative $33 billion between now and 1997 according to the office of the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. (Published 4/23/93)Spending this fiscal year is running so much lower than expected for medical care, deposit insurance losses, interest on the debt and some other programs that budget experts said the 1993 deficit is apt to be $35 billion or so less than the Clinton administration estimated only a few weeks ago.A number of Wall Street budget watchers now expect that the deficit for all of 1993 will be around $280 billion, about $10 billion lower than 1992's $290 billion and well below the $316 billion administration estimate.James Blum, deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), said that unless revenue drops off unexpectedly, the Wall Street projections could be correct. ""Right now, if I were a betting person, I would bet on a deficit lower than last year's level,"" Blum said.The same big drop in interest rates that has homeowners scurrying to refinance their mortgages is responsible directly or indirectly for a large part of the brighter outlook on the deficit.

With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever: Have the financial markets detached themselves from the ""real"" economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product?For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes. And they find it misguided to see the gyrations of the 1998 U.S. stock market as a reliable indicator of either a continued boom or an imminent bust.The stock decline is ""not telling us a thing about the U.S. economy,"" said James F.

Foreign stock markets went for a wild ride in the first quarter, spooked by fears of a slowing U.S. economy and the ripple effects that a downturn could have globally. But most foreign markets steadied by the end of the quarter, leaving investors with some hope that the four-year overseas rally remains intact.The pullback began the last week of February amid signs that loans to the least creditworthy U.S. borrowers, known as subprime loans, were deteriorating. Investors worried that delinquencies in this corner of the property market could spread to the broader housing sector, damping U.S. consumer appetites for foreign goods and commodities.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, contends that the bank discriminated in lending on the basis of age and marital status, and defined certain neighborhoods served by its offices in a way that excluded neighboring low-and moderate-income areas.""In my opinion, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--while harsh in their examinations--is logical, objective, basically nonpolitical and more fairly represents the high standards of our bank, its stockholders, customers and employees,"" Saine told the annual meeting in Richmond.",0,1.0,0.0,4952

Optimism ahead of this week's jobs report is at one of the highest levels since the financial crisis.Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect the economy added 218,000 jobs in June. During the five-year economic recovery, the only time that the consensus estimate was higher was in May 2010, a month in which figures were sharply inflated by the temporary hiring of census workers.With the June jobs report due Thursday (a day earlier than usual due to the Fourth of July holiday), market watchers are hoping job growth will be able to sustain its recent momentum. The labor market is in the midst of its first four-month stretch of job creation above 200,000 since the late 1990s. And the economy last month put the finishing touches on clawing back all the jobs lost since the recession hit in 2007.The jobs report is set to come after a week of disappointing economic data. First-quarter GDP figures showed the U.S. economy contracted at 2.9%, a significantly worse pace than previously estimated.

26,"All Quiet on the Eastern Front?. The United States in recent months has been preoccupied with the Middle East and with the near-term crisis posed by North Korea's announcement that it has nuclear weapons. But there are other long- term developments taking place that will change the political landscape of Asia in ways that will ultimately weaken U.S. influence there. Policy makers in Washington seem scarcely to have noticed, much less arrived at a long-term strategy for dealing with these developments.Since 1945, East Asia has never had the internal cohesion or organization of Europe, with the latter's strong multilateral institutions like the European Union and NATO. But this is beginning to change. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) joined with the three major Northeast Asian powers, China, Japan and South Korea, to form a group called Asean Plus Three in 1998. In addition, the Chiang Mai Initiative links the central banks of 13 East Asian countries and provides swap facilities in case of speculative attacks of the sort that occurred during the financial crisis of 1997-98. At the Asean summit meeting in Vientiane, Laos, last December, the organization decided to hold an East Asian Summit some time next year in Kuala Lumpur that would bring together the leaders of the Asean Plus Three group, but not those of the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, or India.There is a great deal of irony in this development. In 1990, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohammed proposed the creation of an East Asian Economic Caucus, a multilateral grouping of East Asian powers that would deliberately exclude countries like the U.S. and Australia -- a ""caucus without the Caucasians."" The U.S. and Australia were vehemently opposed to this. At American behest, the Japanese quietly sought to kill the idea, while the Australians worked hard to promote a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as an alternative. What Asean Plus Three and the proposed East Asian Summit represent is a resurrection of the old Mahathir proposal, but this time with mighty China rather than tiny Malaysia driving the process forward. Japan, which earlier had acted as America's cat's paw in stopping the Mahathir plan, is now on board.The roots of these developments lie in the Asian economic crisis, and in a series of highly effective Chinese diplomatic initiatives over the past several years. There has always been a huge gulf in perceptions about the causes and consequences of the Asian crisis between the U.S. and countries in East Asia. Americans tended to see the problem as one of crony capitalism, poor corporate governance, and flawed exchange rate management on the part of Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and other countries. The East Asians, by contrast, interpreted the behavior of the U.S. and U.S.-influenced international financial institutions like the IMF as narrowly self-interested, seeking to open up Asian financial markets to U.S. investment banks. To this day, South Koreans refer to the crisis of late 1997 as the ""IMF crisis.""In the aftermath of the crisis, Washington continued to bat down proposals from the region for new institutions to mitigate future financial shocks, like the Japanese proposal for an Asian IMF. Since the Clinton administration had little to offer the region in terms of new ideas or institutions, countries there took matters into their own hands and established the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asean Plus Three. Things have gotten no better under the Bush administration, which has made the war on terrorism the lens through which it saw regional cooperation.",0,1.0,0.0,2915

[para] For some people who thought they had taken care of everything, the answer may be riding on another question: Is your retirement community secure? [para] Anne Bradt, 83, said she and fellow residents thought they had bought themselves worry-free retirements when they put down hundreds of thousands of dollars -- upwards of $900,000 each -- to move into Sherburne Commons in Nantucket, Mass. Then, a year ago, the nonprofit company that runs the place sought bankruptcy protection. Food service was cut to one meal a day. Activities such as dance and music disappeared, along with the activities director and other members of the staff. Residents could still pull a cord if they needed emergency help in the shower, but they would have to pay extra for the lifeline, and the person answering the call would no longer be on the premises.[para] Bradt's life became caught up in a complex legal proceeding, with her entire deposit at risk. [para] ""It's been one year of absolute hell,"" Bradt said. ""It's taken its toll physically and mentally."" The recession and the real estate crisis have raised new concerns for people who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, as much money as it might take to buy a home, just to enter retirement communities. The deposits typically earn seniors the privilege of moving in; they do not confer any ownership in the real estate, and they are in addition to monthly fees that can total thousands of dollars.In theory, residents can reclaim the money when they move out, or their heirs can recoup it when they die. But the model can break down when the communities' economic assumptions prove too optimistic.The October bankruptcy filing of another firm -- Erickson Retirement Communities, a major developer and manager of campuses for senior citizens -- casts a spotlight on the risks.Erickson has been a leader in the world of ""continuing care retirement communities"" -- CCRCs -- which offer independent living, assisted living and nursing home care. In the Washington area, Erickson communities include Riderwood in Silver Spring and Greenspring in Springfield. People move in while they are still able to live independently, hoping it will be their last major move. One of the main advantages is that seniors can stay in the same community as their health deteriorates, and couples can avoid being separated in their declining years.For some Erickson residents, including early occupants of the Ashby Ponds development in Ashburn, it may not work out that way.

But it is our sad duty to inform you that it is that time again. Your four years are up.So letUas get started. What is different about the job that Ronald Reagan offered George Bush last night? What, if anything, has been added to the sum total of human knowledge about the vice presidency in the past four years? In Detroit, much of the external aspect of the thing was unchanged. There were the same craven, sickly, sycophantic bows and smiles on the.part of certain of the aspirants for the job whenever the name of the Great Man, the Incomparable One reposing up there in the heavily guarded top floor suite was mentioned. There was the same continuous shifting of certainty from one hot prospect to another with the same collection of after-the-fact justifications of why the momentUas favorite would be the candidateUas choice.But some of the most durable pieties of the classic conversation on this subject have been affected by the Carter-Mondale years.

By living vice presidency, we mean merely the innovation of actually letting the vice president out of his institutional cage, of trying to substitute useful political and governmental work for the more traditional and much-mocked idleness associated with the office.All candidates for president, of course, have pledged to try this out, but only Jimmy Carter has given it a real test. It has sort of, more or less, vaguely worked: Mr. Mondale is incomparably more active.more heavily engaged in the staff and policy business of his administration than any vice president we can remember.

39,"The Americas: In Canada, a Fat Government Means a Thin Dollar. Harry Johnson, one of the top Canadian economists of this century, used to say that most things about economics are simple; the problem is to recognize simplicity when you see it. This principle needs to be applied in explaining why the Canadian dollar has been dropping like a rock.The mystery here is that the Bank of Canada seems to be doing everything right, producing exemplary consumer price performance. But the loonie -- named for the loon on the face of the dollar coin -- hovers at $1.50 to the U.S. dollar instead of the $1.25 to the U.S. dollar that a consumer price-based measure of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), or the relative purchasing power of the two currencies, would suggest. The reward for monetary discipline should have been a strong Canadian dollar. Instead the legacy of inflation fighting by former central bank governor John Crow is a currency that seems to have no bottom.But while the Bank of Canada sticks to a strict anti-inflation diet, the Canadian government continues to consume a large share of the fruits of the country's productive capacity through a punishingly high tax rate. And this explains much of the loonie's loss of value.Some have argued that it is incorrect to measure PPP using the different changes in consumer prices between the U.S. and Canada. Producer prices are the main reflectors of international competitiveness, and if that measure of inflation is used the Canadian dollar's plight is slightly less puzzling.However, another argument has been advanced by WorldInvest International of London and Vancouver. It argues the PPP based on unit labor costs in manufacturing should be used to discover the Canadian dollar's theoretical value. WorldInvest notes that during the last 20 years unit labor costs have risen 109% in Canada versus 57% in the U.S. Correspondingly, the unit labor cost PPP of the U.S. dollar has moved from C$1.08 to C$1.40.",0,1.0,0.0,4569

As John Kerry showed yesterday, there is a way to make lemons out of lemonade: Mine government statistics to show that, all evidence of prosperity to the contrary, the country is actually going to hell in a hand basket. Voila -- the Kerry campaign's new ""misery index,"" which allows the Democratic presidential challenger to paint George W. Bush as the reincarnation of Herbert Hoover.The original misery index -- the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates -- leapt into the public consciousness when candidate Jimmy Carter attacked President Gerald Ford's record back in 1976. Back then the index was stuck at 13.5. Over Mr. Carter's White House tenure the country only suffered more, as the index shot up to 20.6. For the record, it's now at a historically low level of 7.7, eight points below when Bill Clinton sought a second term in 1996.Mr. Kerry's new misery index purports to tell a different story, and would have us believe that the middle-class way of life is profoundly threatened. Of the seven components, three are based on the price of goods and services that have been rising far faster than inflation: college tuition, health care and gasoline.While these trends are worthy of discussion by themselves, they don't tell us much about the ability of a middle-class family to make ends meet. That's why statisticians use a basket of goods and services weighted according to the expenses of real households in order to calculate the inflation rate. No doubt Mr. Kerry's college audiences this week will be pleased by his pledges to hold down tuitions. But they might also consider whether his cherry picking of figures to get his desired answer would pass muster in their classrooms.Credit should be given where it is due, though, when it comes to gasoline prices. Sure, some of Mr. Kerry's answers to this problem are uninspiring -- ""work more effectively to ensure that OPEC increases production."" And the suggestion that the Bush Administration's collusion with oil companies at the expense of conservation has somehow driven up gas prices is nonsensical. Nevertheless, it's encouraging that in recent days Mr. Kerry seems to have realized that excessive regulation in the form of ""the patchwork of rules on gas all over this country"" has driven up costs.",0,1.0,0.0,4131

Ten years ago, the median was UA.Ua U That contrast goes to the heart of the problem that has affected the quality of corporate bond issues in recent years and will for some time. The heavy issuance of debt by corporations during the 1980s created a situation in which the corporations had to service this debtUOthat is, pay the semiannual interestUOand pay back the principal at maturity.Servicing the debt comes mainly from earnings and, for some companies, from the sale of assets. Some issuers of debt, especially retailers with below-investment-grade ratings Gunk bonds), became so extended that it was thought a virtual impossibility that they could service their debt when they issued their bonds in the late 1980s.As the country slipped into the 1990 recession, many issuers who were marginal credits at best ran into problems paying their debt interest as their earnings fell.Consider a hypothetical example of a company with $100 million in debt outstanding, at an interest cost of 10 percent per year, or $10 million. In normal times, letUas suppose that our company had $20 million available for interest or fixed-charge payments. A credit rating analyst would say that the interest coverage was $2 of earnings for every $1 of interest, and with that kind of coverage, an UIAUaUa rating would probably be assigned to the company.In the mid-1980s, our company became aggressive and added another $75 million of debt at the same interest rate. Assuming no increase in revenue, our company must now pay $17.5 million a year in interest, and the fixed-charge coverage falls to $1.14 for each dollar of interest owed. The rating agency would lower the credit rating to BBB.",0,1.0,0.0,324

REAL-ESTATE buyers are being forced to learn how to ""stack up.""First-mortgage lenders have become more restrictive on the amounts they're willing to lend to property buyers in the form of mortgages. That's partly because in some cases so-called cap rates -- a property's annual net operating income divided by the property's price -- have been falling below levels that lenders consider acceptable. Low interest rates and strong demand for premium properties have driven prices sky-high, so the gap between the price and the annual net income has widened.""Banks are starting to say cap rates have gotten too low for them to be comfortable with,"" says Timour Shafran, managing director of Capin & Associates Inc., a New York-based brokerage firm.At the same time, lenders, including banks and life-insurance companies, want to meet the strong investor demand for funds.

51,"Back to Bailouts. The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury have abandoned their short-lived policy of benign neglect and come galloping back into Latin America. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, in the region this week, is no longer talking tough love. With the recent bailout of Uruguay and a deal for Brazil in the works, he's no longer practicing it either. Will they never learn?After more than $250 billion of assistance to debtor countries in the swinging 1990s, new management at the IMF and Treasury took a new tack. No more bailouts of badly run economies! No more money to defend exchange rates! Losses would teach the virtues of due diligence and careful risk evaluation.This was not a punitive, small-minded assessment. The judgment was that the IMF rescue operations, assisted or even developed by Treasury, had increased risk by encouraging too much borrowing. Instead of taking in risk capital by offering equity, companies in emerging markets could hold on to their equity and leverage earnings by borrowing dollars from local banks. The local banks borrowed dollars from foreign lenders but lent in local currency. This added a currency risk to the banks' default risk. When foreign lenders became nervous about the size of the borrowing country's or banks' repayment obligations, they did not renew their loans. A run soon started against local banks, currency and government debt.This policy reached a peak in the Clinton years, when Mexico, Russia, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina, and others received massive IMF, Treasury, and multilateral loans to bail out banks and pay off foreign lenders. Often, the foreign banks renewed their loans, on more profitable terms, after the IMF put in new money.Wall Street worshipped at the Robert Rubin-Larry Summers shrine. The bankers collected fees for renegotiating the debt. They declared these policies successful because they were repaid, even though countries like Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia suffered deep recessions and ended with larger debts.",0,1.0,0.0,3731

And as 2004's trading year starts in earnest, it looks like more of the same.One would think European Central Bank officials would be dancing in the streets because of the euro's obvious success. But on the contrary -- there is much nervous fretting and fussing in Frankfurt that the currency is too high, that its ascent has been too fast, that something might have to be done about the strong currency, and other such nonsense. In today's Europe, it seems, nothing fails like success.There are, in fact, two reasons why the euro is appreciating. The first is the combination of relatively strong U.S. economic growth and Alan Greenspan's refusal to raise interest rates. The stronger the U.S. economy, the bigger the external deficit -- and the greater the need for higher interest rates to attract sufficient capital inflow into the U.S. to finance the deficit. Without the rate hike, the dollar goes down because the capital inflow will not be sufficient to finance the trade imbalance.The Europeans long have stressed the need for dollar devaluation to correct the U.S. current account imbalance. Now that the correction has come, many are having second thoughts.The second reason for the euro's strength is the credibility of the ECB's monetary policy. Because the ECB's Governing Council has been doing such an outstanding job of pursuing a price-stability-based monetary policy, central banks throughout the world -- but especially in Asia -- are converting dollars into euros.",0,0.6609999999999999,0.3390000000000001,2840
72,"Sharing the Wealth: More Social Security Or Less? Clinton Plan Faces Lots of Questions --- But Stock-Market Proposal Opens Debate With GOP On a Key National Issue --- A New Kind of Savings Fund. WASHINGTON -- President Clinton made a bold opening bid in the Social Security debate, proposing to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in the stock market and to create government-sponsored, 401(k)-type individual savings plans for taxpayers.""We must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth,"" the president said during his State of the Union address last night.The plan, offered in the face of a congressional effort to remove the president from office, drew immediate and harsh criticism from congressional Republicans. But by agreeing to channel Social Security funds into the stock market and advocating individual savings accounts, the president advanced a debate that promises to be one of the most provocative of 1999.For Wall Street, the stakes are huge. The Clinton plan and some congressional alternatives would channel between $650 billion and $1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars into stocks over the next 15 years. At the end of that time, White House officials said, the government would own 4% of the entire U.S. market. A number of Republican alternatives would channel as much money into the stock market, but would do it through individual accounts.The amounts being talked about are large but not overwhelming. An investment of $650 billion over 15 years would equal about $3.6 billion in new money a month. By comparison, individual investors have put $1.1 trillion into the stock market since 1991 through mutual funds, or about $11.5 billion a month, according to the Investment Company Institute.

An off-duty, black D.C. police officer arrived at his home in Prince George's County to find signs of a burglary. Moving from room to room in the twilight, he began searching for an intruder. Suddenly, from outside in the yard, a white Prince George's County policeman yelled, ""Freeze!"" Inside, the black policeman spun and lowered his hands as if to fire a gun. The county policeman fired through an open window and the bullet hit the black man in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.The shot, fired at 6:40 p.m. on Dec. 14, 1987, echoed throughout Prince George's, a county with a bitter history of accusations of police brutality against blacks. Alex Williams was on his way home when the phone rang in his car. As he listened to an aide recount the details, he began to squint his eyes and tighten his lips. ""All these emotions came over me,"" he remembers. "" `Oh, my goodness,' I thought. `I've got to deal with this' . . . The black community was up in arms. The rest of the community was watching to see how I was going to handle this . . .

Williams, the first black chief prosecutor in the 300-year history of Prince George's County, had won election by appealing to black and white voters. Could he continue to get support from both groups in such a racially explosive atmosphere no matter how impartial he was?Blacks demanded an indictment. The county police department investigated and exonerated the officer. Amid cries of ""whitewash,"" Williams decided to conduct his own probe and appointed an independent investigator. The slain man's family tried to bypass local officials altogether, calling for an inquiry by state authorities.In the end, four long months after the slaying, Williams declared it an accident. ""We conducted a thorough special investigation and came up with the facts,"" Williams said. ""We looked at every aspect, met with the family, with all the witnesses, did an autopsy and put it to the grand jury.

83,"Deals & Deal Makers: Rate Cut May Encourage Mergers. NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut could help step up the pace of mergers and acquisitions in early 2001.The momentum that generated eight straight record years for M&A expansion began to falter in the second half of 2000 because of stock-market gyrations and a correction in valuations that damaged the purchasing power of potential acquirers. Jitters about the economy and market volatility prompted investment bankers and M&A lawyers to predict a sluggish start to 2001.But with the Fed's rate cut, announced earlier than expected, some of those concerns could be alleviated.

With remarkable certainty, we know that prices will rise to ridiculous peaks and then plunge or collapse to ridiculous lows. The timing, alas, is a mystery. We have learned, however, that just before crashes and prolonged bear markets, the country often gets happy, even giddy over the market's doing so well so long. Shrewd market watchers take this as the surest sign that a bull market is in the throes of death, even before the decline becomes visible.Maury Klein's Rainbow's End recounts the national zaniness that coincided with the decision by millions of Americans to step into the stock market for the first time in the mid- and late 1920s. Many argued that the country's economy had entered a ""new era of prosperity,"" as President Calvin Coolidge expressed it. Who, after all, could argue with what Frederick Lewis Allen later called ""a ceaseless flow of new delights"": the automobile, the telephone, movies, radios, refrigerators, record players? In corporate boardrooms, something called ""scientific management"" was taking hold to replace the apparently unscientific management of days gone by, when managers simply did what they thought would make money.For the first time in the 1920s, Wall Street firms marketed stocks to the public en masse. The number of ""investment trusts,"" the precursors to today's mutual funds, increased sixfold, with more attention paid to the big names running the funds than to the funds' potential risks and benefits. The number of Americans owning stocks shot from about 500,000 to 15 million. On Oct. 15, 1929, Yale professor Irving Fisher declared (infamously, in hindsight) that ""stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."" Nine days later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began a long and steep plunge that stripped the market of 40 percent of its value in three weeks and continued, with a few interruptions, into 1932. ""All I lost was two hundred and forty thousand dollars,"" Groucho Marx said later. ""I would have lost more but that was all the money I had.""The apparent parallels between the period before the crash of 1929 (the New Era) and the period that led to the market collapse of 2000 and early 2001 (the New Economy) are obvious and have been noted ad nauseum anecdotally in the financial press for two years. Klein, a historian of business and finance, evidently thought it beyond his mission to use the opportunity to explore the similarities, which would have made the book more pointed and useful as a vivid reminder of the ever-present risks intrinsic to equities, which are casually ignored as professionals strive to keep alive the mythology that however bleak the moment, everything will be fine if investors just hold on long enough. One wonders how many investors are aware that after 1929, the Dow didn't regain its pre-crash level until 1954. Twenty-five years is a lot of holding on.Klein's book is not the best place to absorb the market's history. It's painfully slow. It advances no particularly new angles or theories. In its lack of analysis, it doesn't demonstrate why the crash is a ""pivotal moment"" in American history fit for inclusion in the Oxford University Press's series of the same name. The author could not resist the common tendency to see every event as either causal or emblematic of the main event of the '29 crash. Klein suggests, for example, that the fad of flagpole sitting and the craze for flying in the '20s were somehow symbolic of the idea that the market could defy gravity. He is equally unconvincing in his efforts to connect everyone from Babe Ruth to evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to a ""mood"" of ""escapism"" somehow connected with the stock market.",0,1.0,0.0,4034

The index began to weaken in advance of the purchasing managers' survey earlier this year.The Macro-Economic Index forecast this record-setting economic expansion in August 1982 and, in all probability, will prove correct in its current recession forecast. The lead time of recession signals in our index over the past four decades is, on average, five months.With regard to the current buoyant behavior of the equity market, to include a new record peak in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Aug. 24, it is important to remember that the economy and the market were not in any way correlated in 1987.

Byrd (D-W.Va.) to stand by the plant-closing measure is likely to doom the trade legislation even as the nation's trade deficit worsens. Capitol Hill head counters doubt that the Democrats can muster the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to override a veto, especially since major business organizations have said they will support the president in a veto involving plant closing notification.But a bruising political battle between the White House and congressional Democrats could also doom Reagan's own top priority in the legislation, a free trade agreement with Canada that needs congressional ratification.Wright and Byrd acted just hours after they had held an inconclusive meeting with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr., during which it was expected that the congressional leaders would offer to drop the plant-closing measure in return for assurances that the president would sign the trade bill. But both sides said no offers were made. Furthermore, administration sources said neither James nor Howard Baker was prepared to give the assurances the congressional Democrats would have needed to seal a deal.In explaining their decision to stand firm on the plant-closing measure, the congressional leaders said they acted after gauging reaction to yesterday's ""trade figures and the resulting plunge in the stock market.""

Trade in services for the month remained largely unchanged.If the trend for the first seven months continues through December, analysts said, the United States could wind up with its worst trade year in history.Foreign investors were apparently the first to react to the gloomy U.S. trade numbers, fearing that persistent deficits would lead to further declines in the dollar and, with it, declines in the value of the U.S. stocks and bonds in their portfolios.",0,0.6859,0.31410000000000005,1696

If President Clinton gets his way, next year's tax season could bring a bit of relief to middle-class families coping with crushing college bills.But the proposed $1,500 tax credit for parents of college freshmen and sophomores would be contingent on grades: Students would have to have a B-minus average to be eligible. And that provision is stirring surprising concern in higher-education circles.""I suspect it would be the end of any effort to control grade inflation,"" says Thomas Bickel, registrar of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.Though tying financial aid to academic achievement is hardly new, colleges are accustomed to setting their own rules. Most insist that scholarship students remain ""in good standing,"" and that means different things on different campuses. If the Clinton plan is approved by Congress, it could pressure professors to raise grades in certain circumstances, administrators fear. And if so, it would further muddy what has already become a very muddy situation.Hardly anyone disputes that overall grades have drifted up since the 1960s. In a national survey of college students, Arthur Levine, now president of Teachers College at Columbia University, found that 26% reported better than A-minus averages in 1993, compared with 7% in 1969.

When economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, productivity growth did as well, but only modestly.""So it looks like productivity is hanging in there even with our slowdown,"" the Fed board member said.Gramlich told the International Bond Congress that numerous studies indicate that the long-term trend in productivity growth increased in the United States from about 1.5 percent annually during the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s to about 2.5 percent more recently.

NEW YORK -- Texas Air Corp. was poised late yesterday to make a formal offer to acquire People Express Inc., Wall Street sources said.Directors of People Express were meeting here last night to discuss a possible takeover by Houston-based Texas Air. The sources said the bid would be about $4 a share in Texas Air securities, or about $105 million. In addition, Texas Air would provide a cash infusion of $30 million to $40 million in the form of a secured loan to the Newark, N.J.-based airline company.The cash infusion would serve two ends. It would help financially ailing People Express make it through the lean autumn months ahead while the Department of Transportation considers the proposed purchase. And it would help insure that Texas Air would proceed to complete the acquisition. ""We want to make it very painful for anyone who agrees to acquire People, if they fail to complete the deal,"" one source close to People Express said.People Express's concern over completion of the transaction stems from the company's aborted sale of its Frontier Airlines subsidiary to Chicago-based UAL Inc.'s United Airlines unit, which was blocked by labor union problems. United pulled out of the agreement, People Express put Frontier into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code proceedings and it failed to get the $146 million United had offered.

108,"Budget Bloat Hides Good News About Spending. The outcome of this year's budget battle could hardly have been more disappointing. ""Probably 95% of what Clinton wanted, he got,"" lamented Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Mr. Specter's fellow Republicans then added billions more for themselves. Result: a pork-filled budget of $1.75 trillion, bigger than the entire economy of France.But here's some surprising news: The federal government is getting smaller, at least relative to the size of the economy as a whole. This year, for the first time in more than 25 years, federal spending slipped below 20% of gross domestic product. As the chart nearby shows, this percentage has been shrinking throughout the 1990s; it is projected at 19.3% next year. That's still too big, but it's down from 24% just 15 years ago. True, much of this progress is a result of post-Cold War defense cutbacks, but even domestic spending is receding relative to private-sector output.This benign fiscal state of affairs seems incomprehensible, given a Congress that has proved itself incapable of cutting nearly any federal agency budgets and a president who has stopped paying even lip service to small government. But America's miracle economy, helped along by Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp's supply-side tax policies, is outgrowing the budget. The federal budget has grown by 132% in 1982, but the GDP has increased by 176%. And Americans' financial wealth has grown to $32 trillion from $7 trillion, four times as fast as federal expenditures. The trend has been quite different for most of the 20th century. Federal spending as a share of GDP rose to 24% in 1982 from 4% in 1932.Who gets credit for turning things around? First, Mr. Reagan, who won the Cold War, chopped punitive tax rates roughly in half and made the case that big government was the problem, not the solution. Second, Paul Volcker and his successor, Alan Greenspan, who ended double-digit inflation and returned America to price stability. Third, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Steve Case and all the other high-tech entrepreneurs who made possible today's booming information economy.All this progress has happened without any serious effort to cut federal spending. If the next president adopts the right small-government policies, he could shrink federal spending to 15% or even 10% of GDP. To get there will require a combination of modest fiscal disciplinary measures to slow federal spending and a prosperity agenda aimed at coaxing economic growth up to 4% or 5% a year. The policy prescriptions necessary include: personalized accounts for Social Security, a flat 20% alternative maximum tax with unlimited IRAs, medical savings accounts for health care, unilateral free trade, the abolition of corporate welfare and an ironclad commitment to keep the Internet tax- and regulation-free.",0,0.6697,0.33030000000000004,2264

I am-are you ready?-forming a committee to study the possibility that I may, someday and somehow, run for . . . er, president. I am contemplating the formation of such a committee for the following reasons: 1) I am better qualified for the White House than some of the people running; 2) I need a place to live in downtown Washington that has a pool; and 3) I have an absolutely unbeatable platform that has nothing to do with trade, foreign policy, raising or lowering taxes or taking a position on such issues as surrogate motherhood, about which I change my mind almost daily. Instead, I simply propose that all of us-the rich and the poor, Republican and Democrat, Christian and Jew, of whatever sexual orientation-be given a single account number for all our credit cards and other bills. I would make this a law.Under the Cohen administration (merely to write those words gives me a thrill), no one would ever again have to study a bill with Talmudic intensity (and often in poor light) to find an account number to write in the lower left-hand corner of a check. There would be no account number, such as the one I have with a bank that was silly enough to grant me credit, that has-count them-seven zeroes in the middle of the number and that, every month, I have to count out to write on the check. I am afraid, as I should be, that if I am wrong by one zero, my payment will wind up in Ollie North's Swiss account and go to underwrite a dinner for Los Freedom Fighters in a Miami restaurant.The Cohen administration would see to it that each and every bill payer has the same account number for American Express, Visa, Choice, MasterCard, Exxon and even the gas company. Moreover, it would be against the law for any company to add a prefix to your account number, leaving you unsure of just what your real account number is and unaware that you have made a mistake until you try to write the number in the little boxes on the envelope and see that there are too few boxes for the number that is already on the check sealed inside.Moreover, the Cohen administration would insist that all checks be made out to the name of the company on the credit card. Thus, checks to Visa would be made out to ""Visa"" and not, as is the case, ""UV Bak,"" whatever the hell that is. As it is now, I have to pause before writing out every check to see what fool name the company has come up with. Usually, the information is found in very tiny print somewhere in a maze of disclosures, indecipherable interest rates and notices that you have exceeded your credit limit. Visa would be Visa, and that would be it.

110,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Lean, Mean States. The loudest howls about the Treasury Department's tax proposals are coming from state and local governments. It's a refrain we'll hear more of when the president offers his new budget four weeks from now. As New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo and others would have it, the feds are trying to unload their problems on the other levels, especially on the high-tax, high-service states that already take in so much of the nation's wash.We don't want to make light of the buck-passing that is one of the wonders of our federal system. The Treasury proposals do conceal some nasty little traps, and we are not much moved by Treasury arguments that state and local tax deductions represent unfair ""tax expenditures."" But neither are we moved by complaints from governors about being asked to shoulder more responsibilities.States and cities just don't make very plausible victims of Reaganomics. On the contrary, they've been much quicker to benefit than the federal government itself. The Commerce Department's National Income and Product Accounts show that state and local governments were running a total surplus in 1984's first quarter of $13.4 billion. (We're not even counting their social insurance fund surplus of $40.5 billion.) This figure can be tricky as a guide to policy, we admit. Yet it shows an impressive trend. Since the fourth-quarter 1982 trough of the recession, state and local finances have been steadily improving.The rising black ink confounds those dark predictions we heard in 1981. Remember how federal budget cuts were going to force intolerable burdens on the states and federal tax cuts were going to be washed out by state increases? Yes there was a wave of state tax hikes, under the fiscal pressure of the 1982 recession. But the overall impact has been much less than originally thought. In 1983, state and local taxes took some 10.4% of total personal income, three-tenths of one percentage point higher than the 1981 low point of 10.1% but still far below the 1972 peak of 11.5%.These figures bear out what Dartmouth's Colin Campbell argued some time ago. Over the long run, federal aid forces state taxes up, not down. Categorical grants lured the other levels into all sorts of programs they didn't need, such as a ""people mover"" for Detroit's pedestrian-shy downtown. Special interests grow up around the federal spending and demand even more state money. Detaching the grants and their strings frees state and local governments to concentrate on their real needs.",0,1.0,0.0,4120

While recent remarks by individual Fed officials show a pullback in views that further action will be needed, market participants seemed to take comfort in the fact that the Fed stands ready to act if the recovery slows.""The burden of proof remains on the recovery to prove the need for less stimulus,"" said TD Securities economist Millan Mulraine.Treasury prices on longer-dated notes and bonds jumped into positive territory after the minutes, pushing 10-year yields to a new 2012 low of 1.748% at one point.In late-afternoon trading, the 10-year note gained 5/32 in price to yield 1.760%.

114,"Japanese Economy Is Showing Fresh Signs of Weakness --- Some Fear New Recession, Which Would Hinder Koizumi Reform Plans. TOKYO -- Japan's economy is showing new signs of weakness, which could make it trickier for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to carry out his promises of corporate restructuring and economic reform.The government is scheduled Monday to report gross domestic product for the first quarter, and most economists expect a flat figure compared with the previous quarter. But a variety of data suggest that the U.S. slowdown is taking its toll on Japan, and that GDP could shrink in the current and third quarters, throwing Japan back into a full-fledged recession.Among the negative signs: The index of leading economic indicators has been below 50% for three months in a row, often a harbinger of recession. Industrial production fell 1.7% in April from March. Yesterday, a Ministry of Finance survey of corporate investment suggested slower-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, corporate profits were flat in the latest quarter, after growth of 31.9% in the preceding quarter.""It is only a question of timing . . . and not direction -- the economy is heading into recession,"" wrote Richard Jerram, economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, in a report to clients.Mr. Koizumi says further structural reform, such as clearing up bad loans at banks and eliminating wasteful government spending, will help the economy grow over the medium term. In the short term, however, economists agree that reform will likely damage the economy by increasing unemployment and bankruptcies. Should the economy slow sharply over the next few months, Mr. Koizumi would face increasing pressure to scale back his reform plans, among them his promise to restrain government debt.",0,1.0,0.0,65

118,"Book World; Surviving A Quayle Presidency; A Humorist's View: It Wouldn't Matter. Joe Queenan is by his own admission a conservative and he seems on the evidence to be a Republican, but he comes to the pressing question of Dan Quayle with a bracing supply of irreverence. It is apparent from ""Imperial Caddy,"" Queenan's penetrating skin-depth study of the incumbent vice president, that he holds Dan Quayle in slight regard and Marilyn Quayle in no regard at all, perhaps indeed in negative regard, but he goes beyond such frivolous considerations to ask the only question that really counts: Who cares?Or, to put another way: Is there any point in caring since it really doesn't matter? Queenan is of the persuasion - one that finds new adherents every time a national administration swings into ""action"" - that the presidency and vice presidency are essentially irrelevant. The ""Ur-truth about the American system of government,"" he says, is: ""It takes a licking but it keeps on ticking. If 24 lawyer presidents and 32 lawyer vice presidents couldn't destroy it during its first two centuries of existence, nothing can.""Thus it is that Queenan views the possibility of a Quayle presidency - the possibility seemed considerably more real as he was writing than it does at the moment - with sublime equanimity. He does worry a bit about what it might do to the stock market, not to mention the market in Quayle autographs, but beyond that he is of the view that Quayle ""would just be another forgettable chief executive in another era when the rest of us simply got on with our business, which is, for the most part, business.""This is a statement calculated to infuriate those on both sides of the political Maginot Line who really do believe that the fate of humankind hangs in the balance each election day, but then, calculated provocation is Queenan's stock in trade. In the course of his meandering inquiry into the Quayle psyche he manages to take swipes at every target that passes his way. One of these is the great state of Indiana, which harbors a ""strange mixture of gullibility, mediocrity and weirdness,"" and which boasts the nation's oddest favorite sons and daughters: ""Nobody gets famous in {Indiana} unless he or she has a really strange name. George Barr McKutcheon. Booth Tarkington. W. Axl Rose. Edward Eggleston. David Lee Roth. Kurt Vonnegut. Deanna Mertle. LaToya Jackson. Cole Porter. Thelma Cudlipp. Bear in mind that the Senate seat won by James Danforth Quayle in 1980 had been occupied for the previous 18 years by a man named Birch Bayh, who had won the seat from an 18-year veteran named Homer Capehart. J. Danforth Quayle got into politics at the behest of a Hoosier big shot named Orvas Beers, and the principal influence in his life has been his grandfather Eugene C. Pulliam, a conservative who simply hated people like Birch Bayh and, were he alive, would probably hate the current occupant of the governor's mansion - Evan Bayh - even more. In Indiana, even the fictional characters - Carrie Meeber, Kilgore Trout - have weird names. Jesus, what kind of name is Ben-Hur?""No Hoosier arouses Queenan to greater scorn than Marilyn Quayle. ""Something in the way she moved suggested a space oddity,"" he says, and later calls her a ""truly gothic American archetype"" possessed of ""supreme weirdness."" Reaching back into ancient history he recalls one wit's observation about Thomas E. Dewey - ""You have to know Mr. Dewey very well in order to dislike him"" - and adds: ""Ditto Marilyn Quayle.""",0,1.0,0.0,294

TOKYO -- Japan's economy grew considerably faster in the January- March quarter than previously announced, as companies increased their investment during that quarter more than had been thought.Gross domestic product -- or GDP, the widest measure of economic activity -- expanded 0.8% in January-March from the October-December quarter in real, or price-adjusted, terms, the government announced Monday. That was equivalent to 3.1% growth on an annualized basis. The earlier estimate was for 0.5% quarter-on-quarter growth, or 1.9% annualized.The strong GDP figure indicated strength in Japan's real economy, the world's second-largest after the U.S., and contrasted with falls in Japan's stock market, which has plunged to six-month lows in recent days. The Tokyo Stock Exchange opened lower on Monday, as investors sold stocks following the decline in the U.S. market Friday.The main reason for the higher GDP figure was a revised estimate for capital expenditure that was more than twice the earlier number. The estimate jumped 3.1% over the previous quarter, or 12.9% in annualized terms, as companies boosted their capital spending even more than previously thought in anticipation of strong demand. The preliminary estimate had been a 1.4% quarter-on-quarter rise, or a 5.8% annualized rate.Interpreting the combination of rocky financial markets and a strong economy is key to the Bank of Japan's timing of the expected end to its zero interest-rate policy.

That's because Mr. Spirou's $360,000 loan was packaged with thousands of others into a bond, and Mr. Whalen has entered a newfangled derivative contract -- similar to an insurance policy -- that will pay off if enough loans in the bond go bad.""The sophistication is remarkable right now,"" says Mr. Whalen.

The 10-year note auction, an additional sale of the offering in February, drew $72.47 billion in bids--3.45 times the amount on offer. It followed a strong auction of $40 billion in three-year notes a day earlier.Demand from foreign investors, including central banks, was stronger than the recent average in both auctions, allowing the U.S. government to continuously fund an unprecedentedly high budget deficit at historically low borrowing costs. Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. government reported its largest-ever monthly budget deficit in February as the country's fiscal year-to-date deficit ballooned more than 10% to a record of $651.60 billion.The strong bid is even more impressive given the heavy load of corporate bond supply competing for investors' money.

Clarke asked Congress yesterday to amend the city charter to prevent the 12 other council members from receiving automatic pay raises every time the salaries of the full-time chairman and the mayor's senior executives are raised.The request, which Clarke said he forwarded to Congress after the council approved a motion by John Ray (D-At Large), came one day after the council acted on a $20 million D.C. government pay package that increased the annual salaries of council members to $69,500. Combined with a scheduled raise approved two years ago, the action will mean an increase of as much as $19,000 a year for some members.Those increases-triggered in part by the link in the city charter between the salaries of Clarke and other council members-were criticized yesterday by some who fear the increases will exacerbate the District's worsening financial problems.

TIJUANA, Mexico -- As Mexico enters its second year of crushing recession, at least one industry is thriving: the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the U.S.Here on the mean back streets of this border town, coyotes, as smugglers are known, lurk everywhere, pitching their services to the growing numbers of Mexicans looking to sneak across the international boundary. Ironically, the smugglers' biggest enemy, the U.S. Border Patrol, is also their biggest ally these days: A U.S. crackdown along its once-porous, 2,000-mile border has made the journey so difficult that more crossers are seeking expert help.""This border is no longer a cakewalk,"" says San Diego U.S. Attorney Alan Bersin, who was appointed law-enforcement ""border czar"" last year by President Clinton.

David Vitter (R) and Mary Landrieu (D) tucked the request into their $250 billion Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief and Economic Recovery Act, the state's opening salvo in the scramble for federal dollars.The bill, unveiled last week, would create a powerful ""Pelican Commission"" controlled by Louisiana residents that would decide which Corps projects to fund, and ordered the commission to consider several controversial navigation projects that have nothing to do with flood protection. The Corps section of the Louisiana bill, which was supported by the entire state delegation, was based on recommendations from a ""working group"" dominated by lobbyists for ports, shipping firms, energy companies and other corporate interests.The bill would exempt any Corps projects approved by the commission from provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. It would also waive the usual Corps cost- sharing requirements, ensuring that federal taxpayers would pay every dime.With the public eager to help Katrina's victims, President Bush and Congress have already approved $62.3 billion in spending for the Gulf Coast. But some budget hawks are grumbling about the impact on the deficit; the Louisiana delegation's $250 billion bill would cost more than the Louisiana Purchase under the Jefferson administration on an inflation-adjusted basis.

141,"Board of Contributors: Preventing a 1986 Recession. There is a significant risk that Congress will enact legislation this year that will push the economy into recession in 1986. The recovery is approaching its third anniversary and the 33-month average duration of all recoveries. And the statistical evidence leaves no doubt that the recovery has lost the vigor that characterized its first two years. Whether the economy will continue to expand or will slide into recession will depend on what Congress does about tax reform and deficit reduction.The easiest way for Congress to push the economy into recession next year would be to accept the administration's proposal to eliminate the investment tax credit on Jan. 1, 1986. Experience shows that the ITC provides a substantial boost to investment in business equipment. Eliminating the ITC would not only reduce the long-term level of investment spending but would have a particularly adverse effect on investment in 1986.If it looks as if the ITC is going to be eliminated next January, companies will bring forward to this year as much of their planned 1986 investment as possible in order to take advantage of the ITC while it is still available. When 1986 comes, investment would fall off very sharply, causing a decline in overall demand that could push the economy into recession.We will be particularly vulnerable in 1986 to such an adverse shock because, in addition to the natural weakness of a maturing recovery, the economy will be slowed next year by the short-term effects of deficit reduction. Although reducing the deficit will eventually make the economy stronger and healthier, the immediate effect of a cut in government spending will be to reduce demand. The government will spend less on a variety of goods and services, and recipients of transfer payments will have less to spend on consumer goods. The reduction in demand will mean less production and therefore less employment.Of course, the reduced deficit will also cause lower interest rates and a more competitive dollar and that in turn will increase investment and net exports. But experience shows that the response of investment and net exports to interest rates and the dollar occurs only with a lag of 12 to 18 months. The 1986 impact of the deficit-reduction legislation is therefore likely to be contractionary.",0,0.6614,0.3386,1478

Refunds to individuals are unlikely, one FCC official said; more likely, future rates will be cut.Comsat declined to comment on the ruling, but in the past has argued that the FCC has no legal authority to order refunds. By law, it can appeal the decision to the commission itself or in the federal court system.The FCC asked that a lump sum be paid after the pass-through issue is settled.

Should you chase the market and take profits, go into low-yielding CDs or money-market funds, or just stay putUa One viable option is fixed-rate annuities, which are commonly known as guaranteed return annuities (GRAs).A GRA is an investment contract made with an insurance company in which your money accumulates and compounds free from current income taxes. It is this tax-deferred compounding of income that makes a GRA an exceptional investment The investor chooses the length of the interest-rate guarantee period, from one month to 10 years.The tax-free compounding enables your savings to grow much more rapidly than say, a certificate of deposit For example, if you are in the 33 percent tax bracket, a CD paying 8 percent will double your money (your after-tax return is 5.4 percent) in 13V4 years, while that same money in a tax-deferred annuity would double in 8'/; years. You pay taxes only when you withdraw your earnings, and if that occurs after you retire, it more than likely will be at a reduced tax rate.What is key for the investor is the quality of the insurance company, along with the interest rate being paid and the various features in the annuity plan. There are many different annuity plans with flexible features, and to obtain the proper guidance you would be best served by speaking with a knowledgeable specialist.Independent Advantage Financial & Insurance Services Inc.

WASHINGTON -- When Ben Bernanke was nominated to head the Federal Reserve in 2005, he promised to ""maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years."" But in handling his first financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke shows signs of a break with Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman from 1987 to 2006.That shift is important in understanding why Mr. Bernanke hasn't cut the Fed's main interest rate yet, and it could alter investors' expectations of how the Bernanke Fed will function.The Fed historically has had two major economic duties. Maintaining financial stability is one. Controlling inflation while preventing recession is the other.To Mr. Greenspan, market confidence and the economy's growth prospects were so intertwined as to make the Fed's two duties almost inseparable. He cut rates after the 1987 stock-market crash and the near-collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 to prevent investor reluctance to take risks from undermining the nation's economic growth.By contrast, Mr. Bernanke distinguishes between the central bank's two functions. So, on Aug. 17, the Fed cut the interest rate and lengthened the term on loans to banks from its little-used discount window in hopes banks would use the window -- or at least the knowledge it was available -- to lend to solid borrowers having trouble getting credit amidst the market turmoil.

With record-low interest rates and slumping stock prices, insurers say it's getting hard to provide the minimum guaranteed return on fixed annuities, which is set by law in many states at 3%. Every drop in interest rates, such as November's half-point cut by the Federal Reserve, makes fixed annuities even more attractive to customers -- sales were up 56% in the third quarter to $30 billion -- and more difficult for insurers to finance.""What the latest rate cut shows is that the low interest-rate environment we were in a year ago continues, and is more and more problematic,"" says Bruce Ferguson, vice president of state relations for the American Council of Life Insurers, the insurance industry's trade group.To solve the problem at least temporarily, the insurance industry has an answer: Lower the 3% minimum guarantee on new policies to 1.5%.Sounds simple enough, but because fixed annuities are insurance products regulated by states, insurers can't just cut the return across the board.

This was 17.5	percent more than the $128.4 billion imbalance during the first half of 1989 and well above the Gramm-Rudman 1990 target of $100 billion.",0,0.6675,0.3325,4522
158,"Jonathan Yardley. Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls ""Big-time U,"" the ""large public university with high- profile football and/or men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels."" At many of these institutions, he argues, ""beer-and- circus--the party scene connected to big-time college sports events-- replaces meaningful undergraduate education."" The case he marshals against these places--""schools"" scarcely seems the right word--is overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of ""higher education"" in America.Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athletics--Sperber calls Florida State University the ""national champs"" of beer and circus, and with ample reason--but it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important.Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him (in a previous book, College Sports, Inc.) and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, ""just another number,"" rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load.Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities (and some of the private ones as well) are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators ""that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world."" A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni (and anyone else who would listen) that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News; that ambition seems to be universal.But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. ""In the 1980s,"" Sperber writes, ""some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.""",0,0.6639,0.33609999999999995,5004

173,"1.3% COLA Not as Bad as It Sounds. The 1.3 percent raise that federal and military retirees will get in January will be the lowest cost-of-living adjustment they've received since 1986, when they also got a 1.3 percent COLA. The increase is official and will first show up in checks received in January.People getting Social Security benefits -- and that includes many federal retirees, too -- will also get the 1.3 percent raise. It reflects the rise in living costs, as measured by the consumer price index between the third quarter of this year (July, August and September) and the third quarter of 1997. In other words, inflation for that 12-month period rose only 1.3 percent.While many retirees are disappointed with a COLA of only 1.3 percent, most experts say it is a good thing because it means inflation is low and prices are stable. Retirees longing for the good old days of double-digit COLAs forget what double-digit inflation can do to prices on everything from food to cars. In 1979, retirees got a 10.8 percent COLA. In 1980, the COLA was 13.7 percent. And in 1981 (the last time retirees got two raises in one year), they got 13.1 percent. That was a period of double-digit inflation. It also was before Congress voted to eliminate the twice-a-year COLAs that some feared would eventually push the cost of civil service retirement higher than payroll costs.Since that time, federal retirees have had to fight regularly (and usually with success) to get one full COLA a year. There was no COLA adjustment in 1985, and Congress and the White House delayed COLAs for three months (paying them in April instead of January) in 1994, 1995 and 1996.Workers who retire under the old Civil Service Retirement System get a full COLA each year. Workers who retire under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System are under a ""diet COLA"" system. They get a full COLA on the CSRS portion of their annuity. But the FERS portion of their annuity is subject to different rules. For example, if living costs (as measured by the CPI) are up 2 percent or less, both groups get the same increase. But if the rise in living costs is between 2 and 3 percent, CSRS benefits go up by the full amount, while payments on the FERS portion rise by only 2 percent. If the CPI goes up 3 percent or more, FERS benefits equal the CPI minus 1 percent.",0,1.0,0.0,3489

Corrections & AmplificationsA TABLE accompanying a page-one article on the continuing strength of the technology sector contained outdated revenue and earnings data for some companies. A corrected table appears in today's issue. (WSJ Oct. 16, 1995)Looking at the roller-coaster ride of technology stocks in the past three months, money manager Neil Hokanson is cautiously dumping shares of Cisco Systems Inc., one of the most successful technology start-ups in business history.But venture capitalist Don Valentine, looking at global demand for new technology, is hanging on to his big Cisco stake, and goes so far as to claim that selling money managers are ""traitors"" to responsible investing.No doubt about it, there is a lot of confusion about the direction of high-tech these days. A world-wide technology boom is now a decade old, and the magnitude of that boom and the wealth it has created are difficult to comprehend. Cisco, which went public just over five years ago, now has one of the highest market capitalizations on the Nasdaq Stock Market, at $18 billion.

Your May 3 editorial (""Minimum Wage, Maximum Cover-Up"") concerning the Congressional Budget Office study on the impact of a minimum-wage hike was right on the target. It is sad that the House Democratic leadership saw fit to suppress the numbers because they showed the devastating direct impact of a higher wage on jobs and inflation.Another issue the backers of a raise choose to ignore is the ""ripple effect"" of a higher minimum wage. If the lowest salary in a company is increased, those earning more will seek a higher paycheck to maintain basic salary differentials. This would be equally as damaging to the economy as the direct costs.A soon-to-be-published University of Chicago study concludes that when this ripple effect is taken into account, the additional cost to American business of a $5.05 minimum wage would be $60 billion a year. Only about half of this would come directly from raising the pay for minimum-wage jobs.It is obvious this would have a major impact on all aspects of our economy, ranging from consumer prices and overall inflation to international competitiveness and unemployment rates.

187,"After the Boom: Housing Slump Proves Painful For Some Owners and Builders; 'Hard Landing' on the Coasts Jolts Those Who Must Sell; Ms. Guth Tries an Auction; 'We're Preparing for the Worst'. HERNDON, Va. -- For years, real-estate brokers and home builders promised that the soaring property market eventually would glide to a soft landing. These optimists predicted that home prices, which had more than doubled in parts of the country between 2000 and 2005, would continue to rise, but at a more normal pace of 5% or 6% a year.It isn't working out that way. The rapid deterioration of the market over the past 12 months has caught many homeowners and builders off guard. Some are being forced to cut prices far below what their homes could have fetched a year ago. It's too early to say how hard the landing will be, but at a minimum it will be bumpy for many people who need to sell homes. And the economy as a whole, buoyed in recent years by the housing frenzy, could suffer.The pain that homeowners and home builders are now feeling follows a raging national house party. As Americans soured on the stock market after the tech bubble burst in 2000, they poured money into real estate, spurred on by the lowest interest rates in four decades and looser lending standards. Surging demand created home shortages in California, Florida and the Northeast. Over the five years ending Dec. 31, average U.S. home prices jumped by 58%, according to a federal housing index.But mortgage rates began rising and surging inventories of homes for sale finally caught up with demand. Though economists had been predicting a slowdown in housing for years, many homeowners and builders were surprised by how fast the market changed. ""It's just like somebody flipped a switch,"" says Lynn Gardner, a real-estate auctioneer who works in Northern Virginia.""It would be difficult to characterize the position of home builders as other than in a hard landing,"" says Robert Toll, chief executive of luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc., which reported yesterday that net income fell 19% in the third quarter ended July 31.

Unemployment has fallen to 5.2%, the lowest since September 2001.Yet wages for the typical worker aren't even keeping up with inflation. Wages are growing unusually slowly for this point in the economic cycle, especially given persistently strong growth in productivity, the goods and services produced for each hour of work.The U.S. Labor Department says that hourly wages for private-sector workers who aren't bosses rose 2.6% to nearly $16 an hour between March 2004 and March 2005, which is short of the 3.1% increase in consumer prices over that period. Weekly paychecks are up a bit more, but only because workers are putting in more hours. The department's broader Employment Cost Index, which covers more workers, says wages and salaries rose just 2.4% last year, well shy of last year's 3.3% increase in prices.Employers don't give raises because they feel generous. They give raises because they can afford to -- that is where productivity comes in -- and because they have to do so to attract or keep workers. Profits and productivity, up 4% last year, suggest employers have the money, but don't feel pressure to give raises.To those who argue that wages aren't rising because ""today's businessmen are greedy . . . or Wal-Mart is cunning,"" Bradford DeLong, an economist -- and prolific blogger -- at the University of California at Berkeley replies that's nonsense.

But because of a less impressive release schedule earlier in the year, Paramount came in No. 2 for 1988 with a 15.2% share of box office revenue.Fewer pictures were released in the 1988 holiday season than in most previous years, and so far, none of the holiday releases has emerged as a potential $100 million-plus blockbuster.

Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has promised that the central bank will respond ""aggressively"" to the abrupt slowing of U.S. economic growth, but it's far from clear exactly what that means in the swirling crosscurrents of the U.S. and world economies.

202,"At Starbucks, A Tall Order For New Cuts, Store Closures. Starbucks Corp., posting a 69% drop in quarterly profit, said it will close another 300 stores and cut 6,700 workers as it continues to reel from overexpansion and a sharp sales slowdown amid the recession.Looking to share the pain, Chief Executive Howard Schultz asked the board last week to reduce his annual base pay of $1.2 million, according to a spokeswoman. Mr. Schultz suggested a token salary of $1, but the board's compensation committee ultimately decided to cut it to $10,000. Once benefits costs are deducted from his check, Mr. Schultz will earn less than $4 a month in base salary, though his pay package includes compensation in stock.Mr. Schultz said the closures are happening in places where Starbucks built stores under the assumption that the economy would remain strong. ""That economic environment no longer exists,"" he told investors on a conference call. The company has been particularly hard hit by home foreclosures in California and Florida, he said.Under its latest plan, Starbucks will close an additional 200 locations in the U.S. and 100 locations internationally by this fall. That is on top of more than 600 store closures the company announced last year. The chain currently has nearly 17,000 outlets and 167,000 workers.Starbucks plans to lay off 6,000 store workers because of the closings, though some will be placed at other stores. It also will cut 700 nonstore workers at its Seattle headquarters and other field offices. Starbucks is still finalizing the list of stores that will be shuttered.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004,3552

The latest figures on the gross national product and consumer prices suggest that we are still enjoying healthy growth without inflation. If the politicians here and abroad can take the well-recognized steps necessary to adjust their fiscal, monetary and trade policies, the prospect is far from bleak.For the United States, the overdue imperative is disciplining the federal budget deficit. And that requires that Congress and the president abandon the myth that they can sit on their prerogatives and force someone else to make the hard decisions.President Reagan has climbed off his high horse about taxes and agreed that revenues can and must be part of the bargaining.

Ripken, who's hardly one for self-promotion, won't say it, but it's clear that the 30-year-old shortstop believes he has a banner season ahead of him. For perhaps the first time in 2 1/2 years, Cal Ripken is unburdened.Glenn Davis is here and Dwight Evans is here, and a lineup in which Ripken is sandwiched between Randy Milligan and that pair of slugging newcomers seems certain to assure more fastballs in more hittable locations than the eight-time all-star has seen in recent seasons. Ripken said today he no longer feels as if he has to shoulder the entire offensive burden for the Orioles, something he concedes he often has attempted to do since Eddie Murray was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers following the 1988 season.Ripken has resolved to take more pitches, and he's adamant about forcing pitchers to throw him strikes before he removes the bat from his shoulder.

205,"Worry While You Spend. One puzzle these days is why Americans are so confident at the shopping mall and so glum in opinion polls. By many measures, the country's prosperity is broad-based. Families are buying and renovating homes at a ferocious pace. Sales of existing homes in 2005 are expected to reach a record 7.1 million units. Since mid- 2003 the number of payroll jobs has increased by 4.2 million. The unemployment rate of 5 percent is low by historical standards. But in polls, Americans are downbeat. The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence was 74.2 in October, a big drop from 96.5 in July. The three-month decline is the second-largest on record (the first occurred around the 1990 recession).This and other surveys could signal an economic slowdown or recession. There are obvious grounds for anxiety. In October new car and truck sales plunged 14 percent. Although gasoline prices are falling, they're still higher than a year ago. Homeowners will also face bigger winter heating bills, reflecting higher energy costs. Economist Marc Levinson of J.P. Morgan expects average households to pay $900 to $1,000 more in the Northeast and $700 to $800 more in the Midwest than last year. The real estate boom could recede or even implode. Because many homeowners are borrowing against rising housing prices and spending the extra cash, that could hurt ordinary shopping. Should a recession actually occur, of course, the gap between today's strong economy and sour public opinion would disappear.But until then, I have another theory to explain what's been a persisting disconnect between our mood and our behavior: the hangover from the 1990s boom. We subconsciously compare everything now with what happened then; and the comparison favors the past and disparages the present. Almost nothing looks as good as it did then. We were marching toward a carefree future. The Internet was everything -- and American companies dominated the Internet; the business cycle was dead or dying; interest rates and inflation were low; stock prices would rise forever; budget deficits were disappearing; and unemployment was low. The powerful U.S. economy could subdue almost any threat (say, the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis).Not coincidentally, the Michigan confidence numbers reached unprecedented levels in the late 1990s; the historic peak occurred in January 2000 at 112. It wasn't simply that the economy did well. What was distinctive is that it did so well that it suggested we could take its future for granted. We called it the New Economy, which implied that the rules of the game had changed. There were explanations for all this bliss: new technologies; adoption of just- in-time inventory practices; the revival of entrepreneurship. These arguments were satisfying; they were also superficial. Alfred E. Neuman had become our chief economic guru: What, me worry?The central fantasy was that we could dispense with uncertainty and anxiety. Now they've reasserted themselves with a vengeance. We fret about China, a housing ""bubble"" (remembering the stock and tech ""bubbles""), huge trade and budget deficits, oil -- as well as terrorism, Iraq and possible pandemics. The return of worry partly accounts for the weakness of consumer-sentiment polls. People are less confident about the future. But what then explains the strength of actual consumer spending? The answer is that Americans' personal spending decisions depend less on their general view of the economy and more on their personal circumstances -- and these haven't shifted so dramatically.",0,1.0,0.0,304
206,"Invest and Earn. The answer, so far, is the federal thrift savings plan. The 17.07 percent rate is the average annual return for the C-fund (stock index) since it became available to investors in 1988. During the same period, the average return for the F-fund (bond index) was 8.28 percent. The super-safe (no market ups and downs!) G-fund, invested in Treasury securities, had a return of 7.55 percent.Those numbers, compiled by Dennis M.

They have until the end of July to join the plan or redirect where their future payroll-deducted investments will go.Past performance doesn't indicate what a stock, bond or Treasury fund will do in the future, but it clearly shows where it has been. And the C-fund, despite the ups and downs of the stock market, has been on a long-term roll riding the bull market.In calendar 1996, the C-fund returned 22.85 percent. In 1995, its return was 37.41 percent. In 1994 (when many people bailed out), it returned only 1.33 percent.

The first cracks in financial markets appeared in August 2007. That is so long ago, it's easy to overlook just how unusual these times are.Here's one signpost: Investors are so skittish that instead of demanding interest when they lend to governments, they are actually paying to put money into the coffers of the financially sturdiest governments. We have blown past zero interest rates. Investors lend 100 euros (or Danish kroner or Swiss francs) and get back 99 and change.Wow.The European Financial Stability Facility, backed by the stronger governments of Europe, this week borrowed 1.43 billion euros ($1.77 billion) for three months at a yield of minus 0.0217%.

217,"The American Way of Death Evolves. The number of cremations in the U.S. has tripled in the past generation. The cremation rate is now about 17% -- though the rate varies widely from state to state. In Hawaii cremation already has surpassed burial, but in West Virginia cremation accounts for only 2% of the total. Americans are following the lead of Britain, where cremation has increased from less than 3% in 1936 to more than 70% now.Heating technology is a primary cause for the gradual change of attitude toward cremation in the West. If the bonfires used in ancient cultures had continued to be the only means of cremation, the spade would continue to triumph over the torch in Western cultures. But contemporary cremations are neither a public spectacle nor a private repulsion.Crematoria used to be located only in cemeteries away from heavily populated areas, due to public concern about smoke from cremations. Today, the smoke is recycled so that the carbon particles are completely burned. Only odorless vapors escape through a flue from the afterburner chamber. Most units in the U.S. are fired by natural gas. About 500 cubic feet of gas is used in a single cremation, costing several dollars.Although death customs are usually the slowest of all customs to change, Americans are experiencing an increasing amount of dissatisfaction with conventional funeral practices. Funeral costs are a major factor in the decline of burials. Since 1984, funeral costs have risen almost twice as fast as the consumer price index; today an average burial costs $5,000, while the average cost of a cremation is a small fraction of this amount. Telophase, which claims to be the country's fastest growing cremation society, has an inclusive charge of $500.Public policy encourages the cremation option. Social Security death benefits of $255 are available to most survivors of covered workers. Also, the Veterans Administration provides a $300 funeral allowance.

HANOI, Vietnam -- In a further sign of the grim business climate here, some of Vietnam's early-bird investors are flocking home.These investors represent that first wave of daring foreigners who jumped in when Vietnam first began opening its market in the early 1990s. They were once willing to spend the most money and take the biggest risks in the fledgling market, but after three or more years of losses, many are running out of patience.""People are tired of waiting for economic reforms that come too little, too late,"" said Fred Burke, an investment lawyer at U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City.The first investors' departure spells yet another setback for Vietnam's economic development. Vietnam depends heavily on foreign venture capital to support a current account strained by hefty trade deficits. With very few resources of its own, the country depends heavily on foreign capital to fuel growth.According to ING Baring Securities Ltd.'s May report, foreign direct investment accounts for 8% to 9% of gross domestic product, and 17% to 18% of total export earnings. For the first six months of this year, however, total foreign investment dropped 20% in pledged capital, compared with the year-earlier period, according to government figures. Last year, foreign-direct-investment pledges dropped more than 50% from 1996. Economists fear the decline may be even more dramatic than the official numbers suggest.",0,1.0,0.0,3994

WASHINGTON--Two of the biggest companies in the student-loan market agreed on Tuesday to pay a combined $97 million to settle federal charges they overcharged military members and imposed excessive fees for student loans.The government accused Sallie Mae, formally known as SLM Corp., and the new owner of its loan-servicing business, Navient Corp., of violating a federal law that caps loan interest rates at 6% for military members. The Justice Department and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alleged the companies charged 60,000 service members interest rates that exceeded the cap, resulting in hundreds of dollars in excess interest charges.The government said the companies also maximized late fees and failed to adequately disclose how consumers could avoid the fees. In settling the charges, the companies didn't admit or deny the allegations.Federal and state scrutiny of the nearly $1.2 trillion student-loan industry has increased. On Tuesday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said at a news conference that his agency is reviewing whether Navient violated the terms of its contract to manage payments on federal student loans.

233,"Corporate News: More Companies Borrow Short-Time. After working since the credit crisis to push back the time at which their debt comes due, American corporations are now taking on more short-term risk.Concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to dial back the flow of easy money has pushed up the cost of borrowing longer-term funds in recent months. But since the Fed hasn't actually moved to raise interest rates and isn't expected to for a while, short-term funds remain incredibly cheap.That gap has created opportunities for some companies to borrow more short-term cash to buy back stock, help fund acquisitions, or pay off longer-term debt. Other companies are entering into derivatives deals with banks to get more exposure to floating interest rates, or to profit from a widening gap between short and long-term rates.The bet is that rates will remain low enough and markets liquid enough that companies will be able to keep borrowing when their short-term loans come due. It is a pretty safe one, given that the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate close to zero for at least another year. Still, the moves highlight the distortions that have been created by the central bank's deep intervention into the markets.Before the downturn, companies typically funded a lot more of their needs with short-term borrowings. During the financial crisis, when banks were in trouble, short-term borrowing costs for many borrowers spiked and parts of the credit markets nearly came to a standstill. Some companies moved to reduce their reliance on commercial paper and short-term IOUs due to concerns that these avenues of funding could freeze up during times of market stress. And as the Fed pushed interest rates to rock-bottom lows and bond yields fell, companies issued more bonds and longer-term loans, locking in low rates for years.",0,1.0,0.0,4343

237,"Mundell on Supply-Side Economics. Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica, an Italian economics journal. (Reprinted with permission.)Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset.The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25% under {Treasury} Secretary {Andrew} Mellon. But in June 1932, during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a maximum level of 60%. They remained at or (frequently) considerably above this level for half a century. The grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to placate the political right.The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second pillar in the platform of supply-side economics.Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented models of global monetarism and macroeconomics.",0,1.0,0.0,2045
238,"LETTERS. Victor Cohn's piece on ""The Disgrace of American Health Care"" {Cover Story, Jan. 24} did not mention a major factor in rising health care costs-the litigious atmosphere in which medicine is practiced today, coupled with astronomical awards in malpractice suits. His ""Dr. Alarmist"" would have a field day ordering tests-perhaps his patients would have benefited, but Dr. A. would then be armed for the almost inevitable confrontation of a malpractice suit.Few responsible individuals in medicine, government or the legal profession deny that bad medicine is practiced; but advances in research have led Americans to deny that a ""bad"" result is possible.Some states, such as California and Maryland, have already attempted to inject some common sense into the situation by capping ""pain and suffering"" awards, but the legal profession continues to tolerate members who demand settlements beyond believability. Locally, the result has been a sad drain of well qualified physicians to the suburbs, coupled with many simply retiring early and declining to put themselves in situations that can result in suits.In your otherwise fine discussion of spiraling health care expenditures, you misuse the word ""inflation,"" which refers to an increase in price unaccompanied by a commensurate increase in quality or quantity of goods or services.When a nickel candy bar now costs 45 cents, that's inflation. When you buy a three-bedroom house inside the Beltway for $25,000 in 1960 and sell it for $250,000 today, that's inflation.

The failed chip maker's restructuring could have broad implications for the country's other debt-laden firms.Elpida sought court protection in February after falling DRAM chip prices and the strong yen left it unable to pay its hefty debts. The company agreed in July to be taken over by Micron Technology of the U.S. for $760 million and the promise of $1.8 billion later out of Elpida's cash flow. This could mean banks and other secured creditors would receive 70% of what they are owed, while unsecured creditors like bondholders would get just 20%-30%.Some bondholders are livid, saying the Micron offer is too low, ""vague and confusing.""

PollockAs rising prices of oil and other commodities fan fears about inflation, many investors have been stocking up on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities or shares of mutual funds that invest in those securities.The principal value and interest payments of TIPS rise along with any increase in the consumer-price index. And, of course, Treasury debt of all kinds is considered to be among the safest of investments, an advantage over alternative ways of buffering a portfolio against inflation.But some investment managers argue that TIPS alone aren't the ideal solution in an environment, like the current one, in which interest rates could be poised to rise significantly as inflation accelerates. That's because sharply higher interest rates would eat into the value of TIPS in an investor's portfolio.A better approach, they say, is to mix TIPS with other assets that also have inflation-protection benefits but won't be as sensitive to interest-rate movements. These may include such things as riskier bonds that offer yields far above the current inflation rate, and natural-resources stocks and real-estate securities, which may appreciate further as economic growth heats up.",0,0.6572,0.3428,2471

WASHINGTON -- With inflation soon likely to drop into the Federal Reserve's so-called comfort zone of 1% to 2%, Fed officials are seeking to shift their emphasis away from today's benign inflation readings to the more uncertain path of future inflation.To that end, the central bank's policy makers, when they meet next Wednesday and Thursday, are likely to continue to highlight the risks that low unemployment could yet push inflation higher.At next week's meeting, Fed officials are expected to debate whether to continue describing inflation as ""elevated"" in their post-meeting policy statement, an issue complicated by their lack of consensus on whether inflation ought to be much lower than it already is.There is little chance the Fed will alter its target for short-term interest rates, which has stood at 5.25% since last summer.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit ballooned to $10.3 billion in July, a 25% jump over June, reflecting substantial increases in deficits with Japan and China.The deficit with Japan rose to $5.2 billion, the largest gap in about two years and a 27% increase over June. U.S. exports to Japan declined by $478 million to $5.3 billion from the prior month, while imports from Japan increased by $629 million to $10.5 billion. About half the import surge reflected higher auto shipments from Japan. While auto makers complain about Japanese barriers to their products, much of the gap reflects the weakness of the Japanese yen, which makes Japan's auto exports less expensive in the U.S.The trade deficit with China increased 9% to $4.7 billion in July. Most significantly, U.S. exports to China rose a meager 4% in the first seven months of 1997, to $6.9 billion, from a year earlier, while imports galloped ahead by 25% to $32.8 billion. That bleak pattern of trade -- surging imports, nearly flat exports -- undermines the Clinton administration's contention that expanding ties with China will boost jobs in the U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley is heading to China in two weeks and says he will make it a ""top priority"" to press Beijing to open markets.Despite vast trade deficits since 1993, U.S. economic growth has accelerated over that time, reducing the trade numbers' economic significance. Even though the deficits diminish the gross domestic product, other factors keep the economy growing. For instance, imports put pressure on domestic companies to innovate, eventually increasing domestic output and restraining price increases for consumers.However, the trade deficit has broad political implications, especially when increases in imports harm powerful U.S. industries. For that reason, the escalating deficit with Japan is increasing Clinton-administration pressure on Tokyo to open its markets further to imports and restrain exports.",0,0.6831,0.3169,4896

He has agreed to sit down to chat with me on the subject of his lecture.Slumped in a soft chair in a noisy hotel coffee lounge, the 78-year-old University of Chicago professor is relaxed and remarkably humble for a guy who has achieved so much. As I pepper him with the economic and financial riddles of our time, I am impressed by how many times his answers, delivered in a pronounced Brooklyn accent, include an ""I think"" and sometimes even an ""I don't know the answer to that."" It is a reminder of why he is so highly valued.

He was discouraged from publishing it because, at the time, the popular view was that the military draft could never be abolished.

265,"Other Views on the Value of the SAT. Since you asked for our feedback about your article on SAT tests [""What the SAT Tests Are Really Scoring,"" Fairfax Extra, Sept. 8], I will give you my two cents as a parent of a Madison High School senior.First of all, unlike you, I am a fan of the SAT. I think it's critical to efficiency in college admissions, given that some school districts practice rampant grade inflation and others (including Fairfax County) do not. Without the objectivity of having SAT grades, colleges would be missing a critical piece of information in their admissions processes. As I am sure you know, studies have indeed found the SAT to be a good and useful predictor of how well kids do in college.On the other hand, I agree with you that the average SAT grade of a school's students doesn't tell one much about whether that school is a good place to learn. After all, even with the changes, it's still pretty much an aptitude test. Thus, it's going to correlate more with IQ than with the quality of teachers. Moreover, if one's goal is to get into the most selective college possible, I think there's probably a decent argument to be made that one may be better off in one of the less elite high schools, taking as many tough courses as possible and perhaps standing out more from the pack.Your Sept. 8 column was a good piece, but it was incomplete because it did not include several relevant factors affecting SAT scores. While poverty does correlate with SAT achievement, a more powerful correlation appears to be culture.Asians in general and the immigrants from some Latin countries have a deep cultural reverence for education that transcends economic status. On the other hand, domestic underclass culture, particularly that of many African Americans, denigrates promising black students as ""acting white,"" as if scholarship was a racial characteristic.",0,0.6671,0.3329,2138

A majority of states have filed lawsuits arguing that its mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional. But in Vermont, ObamaCare is about to get a trial of a different sort--a clinical one.This coming Thursday, Gov. Peter Shumlin will sign a bill doing what President Obama and his allies have hoped to do all along: sell a public insurance option alongside competing private insurance as a first step toward a single-payer, government-run system. Unlike the president, Mr. Shumlin has been up-front in his support for single-payer care, even on the campaign trail last fall. At least he can say he has a mandate from voters to do what he's doing.The last time Vermont's health system gained national attention was in 2004, when Howard Dean, then governor of the state, ran for president. As governor, Mr. Dean expanded public insurance eligibility, struggling to get as close to single-payer health care as he legally could. New regulations pushed out private insurers, reducing competition. Vermont imposed a guaranteed-issue mandate, which requires insurers to sell to any applicant, and forced insurers to use community rating, which requires them to offer the same price to everyone, regardless of age and health. Both measures also appeared in the final ObamaCare law.The result? The number of uninsured Vermonters barely budged. But costs sure moved--in the wrong direction. From 1991 to 2004, according to the Kaiser Foundation, Vermont's health costs grew by 7.6% annually. Across the U.S. comparable costs grew only 5.5% on average. From 2005 to 2008, in data cited by Dr. William Hsaio, a Harvard consultant studying this for the state, growth in Vermont's health costs grew 8.2%, against a national average of 5.7%.The current governor says his plan is ""all about containing costs,"" echoing Mr. Obama's absurd claim that increased health spending would mean lower deficits. Mr. Shumlin can talk about government health care and savings in the same breath because millions of Americans still believe the myth that socialized health-care models are immune from cost inflation.",0,0.7022,0.29779999999999995,3677

The Senate is expected to approve the measure.The higher debt ceiling would give the government enough borrowing authority to operate until May 1989, and thus would remove the contentious debt-ceiling issue from the realm of electoral politics next year.The bill also would reinvigorate the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law and set easier targets than the original statute. A strengthened Gramm-Rudman was a precondition to approval of the long-term extension of the debt ceiling.

Fox News Channel beat rival 24-hour cable news channel CNN in total viewers for the month of January, the first time the upstart News Corp. channel has attracted more viewers than CNN for a full month in both the prime-time and 24-hour time periods.Fox News has been closing the ratings gap with AOL Time Warner Inc.'s CNN for some time, but this is the first full month that Fox has beaten CNN by both measures. Although January isn't over until Friday, the broadcast industry considers the month over Jan. 27.Fox News averaged 656,000 viewers over a full 24-hour time period in January, an increase of 109% from the prior year, according to Nielsen Media Research. CNN averaged 596,000 viewers, up 51%. MSNBC, a joint venture of Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, averaged 296,000 viewers, up 23%. In prime time, Fox News averaged just over one million viewers, compared with 921,000 for CNN and 358,000 for MSNBC.The battle among the cable-news channels is fiercest for 25- to 54-year-olds, since this is the main group advertisers are trying to reach when they buy ads on cable news. Among this group, Fox News averaged 277,000 viewers during the 24-hour period, an increase of 159%; CNN averaged 202,000, an increase of 64%; and MSNBC averaged 150,000, an increase of 25%.Also at issue is the battle to translate ratings into revenue increases during a recession. Industry executives estimate CNN's main domestic channel still enjoys at least double the advertising revenue of either MSNBC or Fox News, reflecting the premiums CNN has built into its rates over time. Executives estimate CNN ad revenue for its main U.S. service at more than $250 million, compared with more than $100 million apiece for MSNBC and Fox News. CNN Headline News also is estimated to pull in more than $100 million in ad revenue.",0,1.0,0.0,762
273,"A 2 2 MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1978  . THE UNITED STATESUa allies in Europe and Japan are getting worried about the American inability UOor is it unwillingness?UOto curb oil imports. The best reasons for controlling oil consumption are, of course, to protect this countryUas own national security and economic stability. But the debate has been almost exclusively in terms of domestic interests. ThereUas another dimension to the issue that generally goes unmentioned in this country. ItUas the political effect in Western Europe and Japan of the spectacle of the American government lost in wandering, inconclusive debate over energy.The Carter energy bill is still hung up in that marathon congressional conference. The most effective section of the bill, the tax on crude oil, is not likely to be enacted at all. This deadlock in Congress has acquired great symbolic significance abroad. There it is taken as an indication of American refusal to deal seriously with a subject of urgent common concern.The American failure to restrain oil imports has had harsher consequences abroad, so far, than here. Other industrial countries, more dependent on OPECUas oil than the United States, fear that unrestrained American demand will hasten the crisis that President Carter has predicted and strengthen the forces within OPEC that want sharply higher prices. The large American trade deficits, caused mainly by oil imports, weaken the dollar abroad. The impacts on other countriesUa domestic economies are severe, ranging from bankruptcies in Japan to unemployment in Germany. If other governments become persuaded that the United States is no longer going to respond to acknowledged economic threats like excessive oil imports, they are going to try to protect themselves in ways damaging to everyone. That meansNext month President Carter will meet in Bonn with his counterparts from six other big industrial countries to attempt to draft a joint economic program. The United States wants its partners to do a number of things that they say will be difficult and painful. They, in turn, want the United States to do two things: to show that it takes inflation seriously, and to demonstrate that it is not going to let its oil imports keep floating upward without limit. The Carter administrationUas present attention to inflation is probably as much as anyone expects it to be able to do for the present on that score. But on oil imports, it is going to have to come up with much more specific action if it is to be persuasive. Otherwise, Mr. Carter takes a severe risk that the whole summit conference will evaporate in generalities and evasions. The other governments are now fixed on the American performance on oil-import curbs as a test of intentions. If the United States does not meet that test, other governments are not likely to respond with much enthusiasm to the requests being made of them.What kind of curbs? Quotas on oil imports are not an inviting idea. The only other possibility would be import fees imposed by presidential order. The administration is profoundly reluctant to resort to import fees, for it still hopes to persuade Congress to pass the crude-oil tax this year. But that hope becomes thinner by the week. Certainly this country has stronger reasons to act rapidly on imports than merely to rescue an international meeting. But if the Bonn meeting in July is a washout, the fragmentation of purpose among the rich countries is only likely to increase.",0,1.0,0.0,3744
274,"On Sports: A Legacy of Defeat. The voice on the telephone exuded bewilderment. ""I've lived a fortunate life,"" Donald Sterling was saying. ""As a trial lawyer I generated a good income. I got into real estate and, thanks to inflation and this wonderful country we live in, everything I owned went up tenfold. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends. But this basketball team of mine...""Mr. Sterling didn't finish the thought because he didn't have to. Everybody knows about the Los Angeles Clippers, the basketball team he bought in 198l. The Clippers are famous for failure, a club that defies the so-called law of averages by being bad year in and year out.Other teams also do that, but not with the Clippers' obduracy. They were bad last year, when their 9-41 won-lost record was the worst in the National Basketball Association's Pacific Division, and second-worst overall. They were bad the year before, at 17-65. They've had exactly one winning season in the 17 in which Mr. Sterling has owned them, and not many more in the years before that, when he didn't.They have some good young players this season, but, as everybody knows, it takes more than good young players to win in the NBA, and their record through Wednesday was 10-24, good (or bad) for sixth place in their seven-team division. They've won but one playoff series in their franchise's 30-year history, in 1976, and aren't likely to add to that total this year.The Clippers have been good for a couple of things, neither of which professional-sports teams like to claim as distinctions. One is for ticket availability: Even in the new Staples Center, which they and their NBA citymates, the Lakers, occupy jointly, the Clippers are averaging 6,000 empty seats a game, about the same number as they had at their former home at the old Sports Arena (the Lakers generally sell out). The other is as a source of jokes. ""Los Angeles has everything,"" the comedian Arsenio Hall has remarked. ""If you like basketball, there's the Lakers. If you don't, there's the Clippers.""",0,1.0,0.0,1365
275,"Bernanke Open to a Sizable Rate Cut; Job and Housing Markets May Worsen, Posing Risks To Growth, Fed Chief Says. WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that intensifying credit and financial-market pressures are likely to restrain economic growth and left the door open for a sizable interest-rate cut next month.Mr. Bernanke, testifying at the Senate Banking Committee, said he expects ""sluggish growth"" in the economy and a ""somewhat stronger pace"" later in the year, thanks to rate cuts and fiscal stimulus. But he cautioned that housing and labor markets could deteriorate more than anticipated, emphasizing that ""downside risks to growth remain.""Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, at the same hearing, said the government's recent actions -- including the $168 billion economic- stimulus package and efforts to modify homeowners' mortgages -- would help soften the housing-market correction. But he warned that ""those programs alone will not be sufficient . . . . It's going to take time and some pain before we work through this."" Mr. Paulson urged action on legislation to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration and government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and, in response to questions, said the administration is willing to consider other housing-related proposals.The Federal Reserve has slashed the target for its benchmark federal-funds rate to 3% from 5.25% last summer. Futures markets expect the Fed to lower interest rates half a point March 18. Traders put one-in-three odds on a three-quarter percentage point cut. The market odds remained largely unchanged yesterday by Mr. Bernanke's testimony.Mr. Bernanke, who is likely to elaborate on the Fed's views when he delivers his semiannual report to Congress later this month, said market worries about mortgage defaults and the ripple effects of bond insurers' woes are contributing to tighter lending standards. ""More- expensive and less-available credit seems likely to continue to be a source of restraint on economic growth,"" Mr. Bernanke said.

279,"1,160 Deaths a Day . . .. In the escalating war against smoking -- a habit that has taken many more lives than all of America's wars combined -- some states are seeking compensation from tobacco companies for medical expenses for smoking-related injuries, and prosecutors are contemplating perjury and conspiracy charges against tobacco executives who testified to disbelief in the obvious -- the addictive nature of nicotine. In this war, ironies and paradoxes abound.Smokers shiver outside their workplaces, pariahs in a country the father of which was a tobacco farmer. Probably the most powerful disincentive for smoking -- peer pressure -- is also the most powerful incentive for people to start smoking. Most smokers start before age 18 and start because of peer pressure in the search for status and glamour. However, smoking now seems dumb and declasse.Cigarettes are the world's most heavily taxed consumer product. U.S. state taxes range up to Washington's 81.5 cents a pack, and in 20 industrialized nations cigarette taxes are even higher, sometimes five times higher. The ideal revenue yield from such taxes would be zero.By some calculations, the social costs of smoking (in health care, lost productivity from illness and shortened lives, and fire damage) about equal the sum produced by cigarette taxes plus the savings that smoking produces in the form of reduced spending for Social Security, pensions and nursing home care for smokers. If every smoker quit today, that would be a crisis for Social Security and all pension plans that incorporate actuarial assumptions about millions of smokers dying before they can receive benefits they otherwise would collect.Cigarettes generate interesting product liability litigation because cigarettes are harmful when used as intended. The fact that cigarettes are harmful has been broadly understood for several generations and today is almost universally acknowledged. (The one-third of smokers who die prematurely because of smoking lose on average 20 years of life expectancy, or 29 minutes per cigarette.) The consensus about this, combined with the warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising, has helped immunize tobacco companies against liability for damage their products do. Juries have spurned plaintiffs who have said they deserve recompense from tobacco companies because ""everyone knows"" smoking is harmful.",0,1.0,0.0,248

The success or failure of Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad's push to dollarize his country's economy depends less on the technical details than on his ability to do something he has failed to do since taking office in August 1998: gain credibility.Late Monday evening, Ecuador's Central Bank approved Mr. Mahuad's proposal to replace Ecuador's troubled currency, the sucre, with the U.S. dollar. The president of Ecuador's Central Bank, Pablo Better, resigned in protest. Mr. Better was the only member of the Central Bank's board to oppose the measure.As Mr. Mahuad has struggled to deal with such multiple crises as widespread bank failures, a deep recession, foreign-debt defaults, rising inflation and unemployment, he has been dogged by criticism for acting too slowly and too late. His proposal to dollarize Ecuador's economy stands out as the boldest move he has made so far as president. The risk, say critics, is that Ecuadoreans and investors have lost so much faith in the beleaguered president that even this measure may not be enough to save his presidency. Mr. Mahuad's move puts Ecuador at the center of a growing and controversial movement in the developing world toward dollarization or so-called currency boards as pressures on weak currencies push countries to link them to stronger currencies. Some economists have expressed concern over the potential dangers of developing nations sacrificing control over monetary policy to the central banks of stronger, industrialized nations, whose economies have little in common with poor countries like Ecuador.Mr. Mahuad's proposal to dollarize is meant to end the currency crisis and silence growing calls for his resignation. Last week, the president declared a state of emergency to keep protests against his government from getting out of control. Yesterday, there were announcements of a new wave of protests by leaders of Ecuador's indigenous groups who were angered by the dollarization move.""It's not such a bad idea,"" says Michael Henry, Latin America economist at ING Baring.

MOLALLA, Ore.--This town of 8,000 residents has found a way to trim its troubled budget: outsource city-hall jobs to a nearby county government.In 2008, Molalla spent $507,973 on employee salaries and other expenses to handle its building permits, inspections and other construction red tape. In the fiscal year ended June 2012, it spent less than $150,000 for that work.Molalla did it by finding a subcontractor, much as some corporations contract out to specialists the task of making their products. The town is paying Clackamas County to take care of the construction-related work. So far, town residents aren't complaining.Molalla, 30 miles south of Portland, is part of a trend spreading across Oregon among towns and cities facing fiscal crises and seeking to cut spending. The towns of Lowell and Westfir, populations 1,045 and 300, say they outsourced their traffic patrols and criminal complaints to nearby Oak Ridge, population 3,200.Oak Ridge, in turn, closed its 911 dispatch service--which had been costing nearly $400,000 a year--by paying the Lane County Sheriff's Department $93,000 to take its calls.

She is young -- 27 years old -- and successful.Ms. Scott is also part of a fast-growing group in corporate America: black professional women. Between 1982 and 1992, this group grew a heady 125%.

But it is nearly twice the number of black male professionals. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of EEOC data, there were 1.2 black female professionals for every black male professional in 1982. Now, there are 1.8. Though white women have made substantial gains relative to white men, white men continue to have a greater share of professional jobs: In 1982 there were 0.62 white women professionals for every white man; in 1992, there were 0.94.Black women also are making strides in the more general category of ""white collar, excluding clerical.""

When Cuba spiraled into an economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the early 1990s, an ambitious project to renovate Old Havana, the dilapidated core of this nation's cultural heritage, appeared to be moribund.As the government realigned its priorities to salvage a political system that for decades had relied on billions of dollars in aid from its Communist allies, vital restoration of the old Spanish port settlement came to a virtual standstill. Clusters of brittle colonial-era edifices, such as cathedrals and monuments, continued to decay. Some collapsed, particularly during heavy tropical downpours.Today, the revitalization of Old Havana is thriving as a largely self-sufficient enterprise that underscores Cuba's ability to attract badly needed hard currency, albeit not without feeling the sting of punitive measures imposed by the United States.The success of the reconstruction plan stems from a series of recent economic and political reforms that, among other things, decentralized control of the project, giving the agency that oversees it, the city historian's office, greater independence from the state's inefficient bureaucracy and the ability to raise financing through free market means without having to rely on scarce government resources.Administered by a special company established by the historian's office, the funds come mostly from profits earned by restaurants, cafes, hotels and other businesses in the historical quarter that have become part of Cuba's flourishing tourism industry.",0,0.667,0.33299999999999996,4768

Investing in the U.S. health care industry nowadays is like surviving a mortar attack during an earthquake just as a typhoon hits. The competition is so brutal, the cost pressures so unforgiving and the regulatory atmosphere so unpredictable, nobody can fathom what's coming -- even if the stock market calms down.The first lesson, industry officials say, is that health care stocks don't rise and fall in tandem. Instead, there are dozens of sub-sectors with conflicting interests in the business of ""managed care"" -- the buzzword for insurers' attempts to limit health costs by controlling services.Investors seeking quick riches in health care ""had better think again,"" mutual fund research company Morningstar Inc. said in a February report. ""There is no longer a single, largely synchronized, health care industry. The emergence of managed care has not only changed medical care as Americans knew it, but also provided a minefield of investment opportunities.""Take Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the biggest U.S. medical care firm.

OTAVALO, Ecuador -- The long black braid, the blinding white cotton trousers and the woven shoes of the local businessmen here are visible reminders of this community's tenacious cultural pride. But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S.Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors. Ergo, instead of the stereotypical Indian poverty and isolation, the dignified Otavaleno is renowned for his independence and worldliness.There is one thing, however, that Otavalenos share with this country's other Indian groups, mestizos and Europeans: profound economic suffering at the hands of the perniciously politicized Ecuadoran central bank. Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80% of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards; 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6% in dollar terms. Inflation, which in 1999 was more than 60%, is forecast to reach 90% in 2000.Things are so bad here that even Ecuador's politicians, notorious fans of the central bank as an inexhaustible source of generosity, have caught on. This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans.Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country: The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest. Prying their hands off the economy and moving toward liberalization will mean a long, hard fight, well beyond the simple dollar-for-sucres exchange.",0,1.0,0.0,3868
317,"The Middle Seat: Who's Inspecting Your Airplane?; Carriers Now Outsource More of Their Maintenance, But FAA Supervision Is Lax. AIRLINES ARE INCREASINGLY paying other companies to do their maintenance for them. But it has become painfully clear that the Federal Aviation Administration doesn't spend enough time checking up on these outside repair shops.Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board cited sloppy maintenance and lax federal oversight as contributors to last year's fatal crash of a US Airways commuter flight in Charlotte, N.C., operated by Air Midwest. It's not the first time: The safety board has also said federal maintenance oversight was an issue in the 2000 Alaska Airlines crash off the coast of California, which killed 88 people.Aircraft maintenance matters -- a lot. And while great safety strides have been made in many areas of aviation, the recent track record of maintenance oversight is a troubling one for travelers.In an effort to hold down costs, airlines now spend an average of 30% of their maintenance dollars at outside vendors. But the FAA has done little to keep tabs on all this work, according to a report last summer from the Department of Transportation's inspector general. Some 97% of inspections done by FAA officials who oversee specific airlines were of the carriers' in-house maintenance shops -- not third-party facilities -- in fiscal year 2002, the report said. While regional inspectors (as opposed to airline-specific staff) do get out to see more of the independent shops, they often have time for only cursory looks, the report said.Overall last year, the FAA says 16% of all its maintenance ""surveillance activities"" -- anytime an inspector looked at something -- were done at outside repair stations.",0,1.0,0.0,773

319,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Tower of Babble. Bill Clinton did his best to look attentive at his economic summit yesterday, but to really understand what was going on the President-elect would have needed earphones with instant translation. How else could he, or anyone else, make sense of this economic tower of babble?That may seem harsh, but is there a theme we're missing here other than that the country's a mess and Mr. Clinton plans to do something about it? Opening the two-day conference, Mr. Clinton dusted off his campaign stump speech, which may have been only prudent since no conclave of 300 people is ever going to be more than a giant bull session. Some in the Clinton camp have thought this was a dumb idea from the start, which is at least reassuring. Their least-awful solution has been to make the event a kind of economic ""Oprah,"" in which designees from all sides of the Clinton coalition get to explain how they feel about the economy.So we have economist Allen Sinai, who supports a cut in the capital gains tax, communing with MIT Keynesian Robert Solow, who wants to raise virtually every tax known to man. David Osborne, the ""reinventing government"" author, gets to schmooze with Ken Geiger of the teachers' unions, which think public schools with 50% drop-out rates deserve more money. Perhaps they'll all have a mind meld.Assorted small-business owners (such as the trendy folk at neo-prep clothier J. Crew), who are supposed to create all sorts of ""high-wage jobs,"" get to mingle with Jessica Tuchman Mathews, who would saddle those same owners with new environmental rules that cost jobs. Our favorite name on the summit list, we have to admit, is Chief Wilma Mankiller, representing the ""Cherokee Nation,"" though we hope not a feminist economic priority.Our own view, since Mr. Clinton is asking, is that the U.S. is not in fact in any economic crisis. The economy is now expanding, more slowly than we'd like, but enough so that any ""short-term"" stimulus would be counterproductive. If there is an economic emergency now, it's in Japan and Germany, which are both in recession and have long-term structural problems. Far from beating our brains out, Japan in particular might soon be asking the Clinton administration for financial help.",0,1.0,0.0,1985

The poll also shows Mr. Gephardt with the support of only 10% of likely Democratic participants, trailing Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, at 21%, and Massachusetts Gov.

Tom Blair, founder and chairman of United Payers and United Providers, a Rockville-based health care financing company, was just one day away from the company's initial public stock offering when his investment bankers delivered the bad news on July 1.With the market in a skid, you're not going to get as much as you want for your stock, the bankers bluntly told Blair and his partners. They gave them a choice: Postpone the offering for several months or cut the price.Instead of asking $13 a share for the stock as planned, the company cut the price to $11 and on July 2 sold 2.4 million shares. The offering raised $26 million in capital for the company, known as Up and Up, which helps insurance companies provide medical services at lower costs by prepaying hospitals. If the same number of shares had been sold at $13, Up and Up would have raised an additional $5 million, and could have raised even more if the stock had been issued for the $15 to $17 price projected when the issue was planned during the spring stock market boom.Whether it's called a correction, a sell-off or the beginning of the end of the longest bull market in history, this summer's stock market slump, which is hitting tech stocks particularly hard, is costing entrepreneurial Washington companies -- even if, like Up and Up, they are not in technology sectors -- millions of dollars.The Nasdaq Composite Index -- which consists of the stocks of many of the area's and the nation's fastest-growing companies -- closed at 1,096.68 Friday, down 12.2 percent from its peak this year of 1,249.14 on June 5.

Sales have now climbed for three consecutive months after flagging during the spring.The stronger retail numbers provide some of the first evidence rising consumer confidence is translating into actual spending.

I have no immediate need for them or the Spanish pesetas, Greek drachmas or Dutch guilders that I might also have purchased. I just wanted some historic mementos, because after Jan. 1 the national currencies of 12 European countries with 305 million people are scheduled to disappear in favor of the euro. Although I have long doubted the euro's benefits, the moment is undeniably historic.Never before have so many people in so many countries simultaneously adopted a new money. Since 1999 stores and banks have priced in both euros and national currency; now people get the real stuff. The conversion is a massive operation. The European Central Bank (ECB) has minted 52 billion new coins (170 for each person in the ""euro area"") and printed 14.9 billion bank notes (49 per person). The total value is 649 billion euros, which, at present exchange rates (1 euro equals about 90 cents), is about $584 billion.Throughout history, money -- its creation or destruction -- has always been a political act. The euro has been controversial precisely because it engages vast political ambitions. To critics, it represents a step toward ""a European super-state that will submerge the individuality of the European nations in an unwieldy federation, hobbled by bureaucracy [that imposes] a crippling burden of regulatory and other costs on Europe's economies,"" wrote one British commentator. Having reservations, three of the European Union's 15 members -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden -- have so far rejected the euro.To its enthusiasts, the euro means economic vitality and political unity. Companies won't have to convert all those different currencies. Easier cross-border price comparisons will compel firms to become more efficient. As cross-border investment rises, money will increasingly go to the most deserving companies. Economic success will strengthen a European consciousness.Let's hope so. But I'm skeptical, because I fear that (a) the euro won't create major economic gains and that (b) it will trigger a political backlash. So much economic power is being centralized in Frankfurt and Brussels -- the homes of the ECB and the European Commission -- that local and global economic discontent may focus increasingly on ""Europe"" as the villain.",0,1.0,0.0,845

It is widely expected to fail, but the degree of support for the plan could prove a bellwether of whether Congress decides to pursue a broad bipartisan budget deal this election year.The proposal pushed by Reps.

346,"Fed Is Seen Keeping Tight-Credit Policy Despite New Evidence of Low Inflation. NEW YORK -- Despite additional evidence of low inflation, Federal Reserve System officials still fear that the economy is growing too rapidly and that inflation could surge by early next year.As a result, the Fed, whose policy-making arm meets today and tomorrow, probably will try to keep short-term interest rates in the next few weeks close to their current lofty levels, or slightly higher, according to bankers, economists and sources close to the Fed.Some congressional critics contend that such a policy could lead to economic disaster. Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.) argues that the Fed's credit policy already is much too tight and has intensified international financial strains. He also insists that Wall Street fears about inflation are wildly exaggerated, especially in view of continued continued declines in commodity prices as well as a government report Friday showing the producer price index remained unchanged in June for the third consecutive month.Nevertheless, many analysts predict that the Fed this week will decide to keep a firm grip on credit conditions, and possibly even tighten its clamp slightly, in an effort to cool off the economy and keep inflation subdued.

Regarding Kimberley Strassel's ""This Unserious White House"" (Potomac Watch, Nov. 30): A White House that is deadly serious about transforming America and a president who openly admits a willingness to sacrifice growth for fairness need not be too serious about averting a fiscal cliff. If primary objectives are to expand the welfare state and redistribute as much income as possible in the process, the fiscal cliff and a possible recession are not so alarming, particularly since the media are teed up to blame obstinate Republicans for an impasse. The Journal's same-day news headline ""Obama's Cliff Offer Spurned"" generally leads a skim-reader to sympathize with the one being spurned, not the one doing the spurning.For historical perspective on the Obama era, the 1930s are most instructive. In the mid-1930s President Franklin Roosevelt's second term was dedicated to preserving New Deal entitlements and programs and building federal government power. Economic growth was an afterthought. Unemployment was about 15% when his second term began and about 15% when it ended (and higher in between). The stock market sank. Washington grew much faster than the private sector. FDR's legacy, had he not served a third term after 1940, would be: He saved capitalism from itself after Republicans and Wall Street mucked it up; he created massive new benefit plans and vastly increased the state's reach and resources; and he browbeat the rich into submission while redistributing income with a vengeance. He did not, however, engineer a sustained economic recovery. Instead, he transformed the nation in eight years and for that he most likely would be ranked as a top-10 president regardless of his poor economic results and without his World War II leadership.The economy has its ups and downs, and President Obama has been immunized from responsibility for the downs -- as was FDR. Widespread tax increases, drastic cuts in defense spending, no substantive reform of entitlements and little White House accountability for economic pain may be a perfectly acceptable, if not desirable, outcome. It actually may be harder for President Obama to leapfrog FDR on the transformation (and top-five presidential ranking) scale if the economy is humming along and people need less help from Washington. The fiscal cliff is as rare an opportunity as was the Great Depression to permanently alter the balance of power between public and private sectors.

An extremely grim world economic situation has emerged in the past year because of high inflation on a global scale, a marked slowdown in growth and volatile trading relationships, according to the annual report of the International Monetary Fund.The IMF also warned that the impact of soaring trade deficits in developing countries that do not produce oil is threatening the ability of these nations to find financial support for continued trading and economic expansion.A slowdown in industrial nations could lead to a halt in the expansion of world trade and create another international recession, the Washington-based organization said in a report scheduled for publication next weekend.Privately, officials of the IMF have said they expect that a major theme of debates at the world bodyUas annual meetings starting here later this month will he urgent appeals by developing nations for more extensive help from the richer countries.At the same time, an IMF official forecast that the predicted debates are not expected to result in substantive policy changes or initiatives from the rich countries.

372,"Magellan Has Gotten Too Big For Its Britches, and Your Money. Fidelity's Magellan Fund is the biggest mutual fund in history. Its $56 billion of assets make it twice the size of its closest rival, and bigger than the economies of Ireland or Iraq. Magellan is not only big, but popular; it has almost 4.4 million shareholders, about a third more than AT&T, the country's most widely held stock. And Magellan, which has a superb long-term record and was the launch pad for financial superstar Peter Lynch, is by far the best brand name in the fund biz. ""Magellan is the only fund in the country that the average person in America has heard of,"" says Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco mutual fund consultant.But last week, Magellan manager Jeffrey Vinik announced that he's not only quitting the fund but is leaving Fidelity to set up his own money management company. Fidelity Investments is installing its third Magellan manager in less than six years; by contrast, Lynch ran the fund for 13 years. What's going on here? Why has Magellan begun to devour managers at a rate seen only in professional sports? And more important, do you want to put your money into Magellan? If your money is there now, should you leave it in?I don't think Magellan's problem is Vinik, who was chewed up and spat out by the job in less than four years. Or his predecessor, Morris Smith, who lasted only 25 months. But rather, as I wrote in March, I think the problem is Magellan itself. The fund is so big and its profile is so high that I doubt it's sufficiently nimble to outperform the stock market by enough of a margin to be worth it. If Magellan isn't going to be a star, who needs it? You can buy a boring, low-cost index fund instead.Should you wait to see how Magellan's new manager, Robert Stansky, performs? Isn't he one of Fidelity's brightest stars? Yes, but if you look at the fund's post-Lynch record, you see a disturbing trend. The legendary Lynch outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by a whopping 13.6 percentage points a year. But his tenure began when Magellan was a private fund with only $6 million in assets. When he quit, the fund had $14 billion. Smith outperformed the S&P by 3.6 points, and the fund had $20.6 billion when he left. Vinik beat the S&P by less than a point, and the fund has $56 billion. See a pattern here?To be fair, Vinik was going gangbusters until last fall; through Sept. 11, 1995, to be exact. Until then, he had outperformed the S&P by 7.5 points a year, according to Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research firm. Since September, he has underperformed the S&P by 20 points. That's right, 20 points. He was an amazingly good 31st out of 363 growth funds during his up period, and an amazingly awful 812th out of 820 since then. In hindsight, we can see that one of the reasons Vinik did so well at first was that he guessed right on technology stocks, and his continuing, massive purchases drove their price up, enhancing his performance. But when he began selling, it drove down prices, hurting his performance as he continued to unload. Also, having guessed right on the techies, he guessed wrong by buying bonds, which have been stinko performers. This isn't investing, its gambling.",0,1.0,0.0,4268

382,"Trade Chasm Set Unwanted Record in '04; Gap Narrowed in December, But Annual Figure Ballooned. The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in December but was still the second-highest monthly figure ever. And that lifted the deficit for 2004 to $617.7 billion -- an all-time high that shattered the previous record, set in 2003, by 24 percent.The trade report, issued yesterday by the Commerce Department, capped a year in which the voracious demand by Americans for imported goods drove the deficit to proportions all but unheard of for a major industrial country -- 5.3 percent of gross domestic product, up from 4.5 percent the year before. The widening gap has deepened worries that the United States is growing dangerously dependent on the capital lent by foreigners to cover the cost of the products they sell to Americans.The December deficit decline to $56.4 billion from a revised record of $59.3 billion in November offered some hope that the trade gap's relentless surge might abate in coming months. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that the deficit may soon start leveling off and possibly even shrink. Greenspan cited the dollar's fall against other currencies, which makes U.S.-made goods more competitive with products made abroad.But yesterday's report offered insight into why a turnaround may be a long way off, because as the Commerce summary noted, imports increased nearly twice as much as exports last year. That is the opposite of what must happen for the deficit to narrow. Since the $1.764 trillion that the United States imported in 2004 is so much greater than the $1.146 trillion that it shipped abroad, exports must grow much faster than imports to close the gap.""The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply, but let's not get carried away,"" said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, in a report to clients. ""The level is still the second highest we have ever recorded . . . the deficit is still way too wide.""",0,0.6721,0.3279,2823

385,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Budget Cutting Made Easy. Congress finally has figured out a way to cut the federal deficit. It's called paralysis. As long as Congress fails to boost the federal debt ceiling it will have the best of all possible worlds. It can appropriate funds to its heart's content, to subsidize farmers, Amtrak riders, subway builders, merchant seamen, doctors, lawyers, beggarmen, chiefs. But if the president can't borrow, he can spend only what the government takes in. So, in a process called ""deferral"" he simply tells a lot of constituencies, ""We'll send you the money when we get it.""Compared with what we've had, it's not a bad way to run the government. In the process of deferring, the president must make economic choices, deciding, for example, whether it is more important to build a shopping center in Des Moines or protect the U.S. from nuclear attack. Any process that forces such choices represents progress -- a kind of shotgun item veto.Congress has demonstrated once again this year that it cannot make economic choices on its own. The separate House and Senate ""deficit-reduction"" bills to be reconciled this week were properly described to the Associated Press by an anonymous OMB official as mostly phony, except of course for the new taxes. Appropriations bills currently under consideration by the two bodies, for agriculture, transportation, labor, health and education, are billions of dollars over budget. In forecasting federal spending, it is appropriations bills, not budget resolutions, that count.So what ""deficit reduction"" really distills down to is an effort to wangle some new taxes. The Senate wants to introduce the equivalent of a European-style value added (VAT) tax into the American tax system, under the guise of a special levy to clean up ""toxic wastes."" It also wants to add a new import duty to finance ""worker retraining"" in the U.S.; since there has never been a huge demand for retraining under existing programs, it must be assumed that the main objectives are revenues and a little discreet protectionism.As always, revenue enhancers have some guileful arguments. They say, for example, that just-released budget figures for fiscal 1985 demonstrate that the federal deficit expanded even in a time of economic recovery. The deficit did expand, to $211.9 billion from $185.3 billion the preceding year, and even though the recovery slowed sharply this year there was indeed a recovery of sorts.",0,0.6718,0.32820000000000005,4567
386,"Risky Strategies Take Toll on Traders; Derivative Products Suffer Amid Increasing Concerns Surrounding Corporate Debt. Intricate and risky trading strategies in credit markets are suddenly causing pain, amid concerns about diminishing corporate credit quality.Among the credit-derivative products facing pressure: collateralized-debt obligations, or CDOs, and credit-default swaps. CDOs typically are repackaged corporate debt with varying yields and levels of corporate risk. Investors can opt for CDO slices ranging from investment-grade corporate debt to unrated, extremely risky debt. Credit-default swaps are essentially products that provide insurance against a potential corporate debt failure.In both markets, turmoil has erupted, raising the pressure on investors such as hedge funds and Wall Street dealers to cut losses or reprice their positions. Speculation of hedge-fund troubles dogged the credit markets throughout yesterday's trading session.The Dow Jones CDX index of investment-grade credit-default swaps yesterday widened to 72 basis points, or 0.72 percentage point, from 63.25 basis points Monday, according to GFI Group. The European iTraxx indexes also came under selling pressure in the afternoon. The high- yield crossover index took the biggest hit, widening 25 basis points against a key benchmark to 380 to 385.

Ron Paul, the 2008 presidential candidate who had the zany idea -- as many laughing people thought -- that the Federal Reserve system could become a sizzling political issue. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, who does not laugh promiscuously, knows that it is no laughing matter that Paul has 317 co-sponsors (180 Republicans, 137 Democrats) for a bill to open the Fed's books to ""audit"" by the comptroller general.The canny congressman cannot accomplish what the title of his best-selling book recommends: ""End the Fed."" But he probably hopes that if the Fed's transactions with financial institutions were publicized, he and kindred spirits could stir populist resentment of the mysterious institution. Although profoundly mistaken in his objective -- breaking the Fed to Congress's saddle -- Paul is not frivolous. His rage against the Fed is rooted in his rejection of fiat money -- paper money backed by nothing but confidence in Congress (really), and his libertarian enthusiasm for maximizing the role of unmanaged markets in allocating social rewards.Bernanke on Monday told the Economic Club of Washington that Congress already can examine the Fed's balance sheet. His worry is that Congress, by ordering audits when it dislikes Fed monetary policy decisions, might make the Fed seem subject to, and eventually actually make it subject to, congressional pressure.At Bernanke's recent confirmation hearing on his nomination for a second four-year term, Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican who is co-sponsoring a Senate version of Paul's bill, asked Bernanke: ""Do you believe that employment should be a mission, a goal of the Federal Reserve?"" Bernanke, who had already noted Congress's ""mandate"" that the Fed ""achieve maximum employment and price stability,"" answered that the Fed ""can assist keeping employment close to its maximum level through adroit policies.""That mandate was, however, improvidently given. Congress created the Fed and can control it, and eventually will do so if the Fed eagerly embraces the role of the economy's comprehensive manager.

400,"Board of Contributors: Don't Waste the Budget Surplus. The federal budget surpluses now projected for the coming years provide an unprecedented political opportunity for fundamental reform of Social Security. That reform would cut taxes now for every working person while laying the foundation for a more secure retirement.First some budget facts. Lower defense spending, limits on the growth of nondefense outlays, and the surging tax revenue that has resulted from strong economic growth have combined to cut the budget deficit for the 1997 fiscal year, which ended in September, to only $22 billion -- about 0.25% of gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office projected earlier this year that the budget would be in surplus by 2002 and would remain there for the rest of the decade. The strong growth and high tax receipts of the past few months are now likely to require a revised budget forecast that accelerates the surplus, probably to the current fiscal year.A decade of budget surpluses would be a welcome change after decades of budget deficits. Surpluses would automatically shrink the national debt, which has grown to nearly $4 trillion. A smaller national debt would mean lower future taxes to meet government interest payments. Budget surpluses would also automatically raise the national saving rate. That would finance increased investment in plant and equipment, raising productivity and real wages. And the higher national saving rate would make the U.S. less dependent on capital inflows from abroad.But despite these desirable effects of potential budget surpluses, Congress and the Clinton administration are unlikely to let them last very long. That's because while there is broad public support for the goal of a balanced budget, there isn't broad support for running budget surpluses in order to shrink the national debt. So Washington is already talking about new spending initiatives and special-interest tax breaks that would eliminate those surpluses.Fortunately, there is a better alternative that should have enough popular support to make it politically viable: using the projected surpluses to fund a system of mandatory Personal Retirement Accounts modeled on the very successful and widely used 401(k) plans. A system of PRAs would achieve the same gain in national saving that budget surpluses would. It would also have the popular appeal of a personal tax cut and yet the long-term benefit of more reliable retirement income with lower future taxes.",0,0.6964,0.3036,1012

But the Midwest, bogged down in a manufacturing slowdown, is catching up quickly.Those are among the highlights of a report released yesterday by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on so-called mass layoffs, where companies terminate 50 or more employees at once, and the employees file for unemployment insurance. The report indicated that while mass layoffs started 2000 little changed from a year earlier, layoffs rose 54% for the fourth quarter from a year earlier as a slowing economy prompted big companies to make sharp cuts in their work forces. In the October to December period, there were 5,248 mass-layoff events involving 647,012 workers, compared with 3,943 events and 420,827 workers a year earlier.For the entire year, there were 15,738 mass-layoff events affecting 1.84 million workers, compared with 14,909 events affecting 1.57 million in 1999. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of the job cuts occurred in manufacturing, which accounted for 35% of all layoff events and 42% of all workers.""Virtually everyone has been willing to admit that the manufacturing sector is miserable; the question now is whether that weakness spreads out to other areas of the economy,"" said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney.The distribution of mass layoffs on a state-by-state basis showed some surprising results.

We can buy embryos at the hospital. Museums make more money from their shops than from any other single source. And we are happy to treat ourselves to cultured gift wrap.

A U.S. company can rent a train car for a mere $2.5 million a year.Though most U.S. companies that signed on for the ride are excited about the train, nobody thinks it will have a lasting impact on the real problem facing would-be exporters to Japan: getting U.S. goods into its complex distribution system.This isn't the first time Japan has come up with superficial ways to attack the trade surplus. In 1985, Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time, tried to command each Japanese to buy $100 of foreign goods. Bureaucrats drew up lists of suggested products, such as fondue pots and oven thermometers.",0,1.0,0.0,2797

432,"The Best Oil Policy Is No Oil Policy. After lying low for a couple of decades, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is back with a vengeance. The cartel has rediscovered its economic muscle and driven up oil prices to more than $30 a barrel. Democrats and Republicans alike are demanding that government bring down prices. But before we dust off the policy playbook of the Carter era, we should recall some lessons learned.First, begging OPEC heads of state to increase production -- as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is now doing -- is a waste of time. Production decisions are determined by financial considerations. Nothing will change that. Trying to convince OPEC that it's in the cartel's best interest to head off a global recession -- thus, that it should increase oil production -- is naive. OPEC members are almost entirely dependent on the oil trade. So long as oil profits remain robust, global recession need not concern them. The recessions of 1974 and 1979 demonstrated that OPEC can make a lot of money during hard times.Second, investigating ""big oil"" for price gouging is counterproductive. In the 1970s those suspicions were stoked by stories of oil tankers lingering offshore, supposedly waiting for prices to go up before they unloaded their cargo. Tankers were indeed lingering, but it was because docks were overloaded and ships had to wait to unload. Big oil -- then and now -- is guilty only of passing on its increased costs to consumers instead of selling at a loss.Political saber rattling about alleged corporate profiteering makes the crisis worse. The only hedge against supply disruptions in the near term is inventories. But inventories are costly to maintain. If companies can't cash them out at a profit during price spikes because they fear criminal investigation or the imposition of windfall-profit taxes, they won't bother maintaining inventories.Ironically, that is the upshot of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Politicians, alarmed that oil companies don't keep stockpiles, decided that the government must do so. Yet the existence of the reserve makes it certain that companies won't stockpile. Oil companies don't know if or when government might flood the market, dropping prices and preventing them from profiting from their inventories.",0,1.0,0.0,1404

Employers cut jobs in April for the fourth month in a row, but the small size of the drop -- 20,000 jobs -- and a dip in the unemployment rate offered a tentative sign that the U.S. economy might be escaping a deep recession.Despite the better-than-expected news, the economy is not healthy. Car sales hit their lowest level in nearly a decade in April, while the fall in home prices is accelerating and consumers are feeling the pain of higher food and energy bills.

Since first-time buyers are usually the most price-sensitive, last year's 2-percentage-point jump in mortgage rates to above 9 percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan could logically have been expected to push them out of the market.But in an analysis of its survey results, Chicago Title speculated that because these buyers didn't have to sell their old home before buying a new one, they were in the best position early in the year to move quickly when it became obvious that rates were on the way up.As the year wore on, first-time buyers chose adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to keep their monthly mortgage payments down, said John Pfister, vice president and marketing research manager at Chicago Title.The company, which sells title insurance, has been surveying buyers for 19 years and conducts its poll on a representative sampling of buyers in 18 major markets, including the Washington area.",0,1.0,0.0,2540
438,"How 'Worst' Bond Fund Did It. WHILE MANY INVESTORS got hit by the bond market's recent selloff, a small bond-focused mutual fund that uses complex derivatives strategies took a particularly rough beating.FBR Total Return Bond Fund returned a negative 19.08% in the month of July, the worst performance among more than 3,900 bond funds tracked by Lipper Inc. The fund bounced back to a peer-beating 8.60% gain in the first week of August, but its negative 15.53% return so far this year, through Friday, still ranks as the worst bond-fund performance of 2003. Yesterday, the fund was down a further 2.42%.Investment professionals have speculated that other bond portfolios, possibly including some hedge funds, may have been bloodied in the bond-market tumble, but so far no significant examples have emerged. As interest rates surged and bond prices fell, the month of July saw taxable-bond mutual funds post their worst monthly loss in 16 years, since April 1987, Lipper said. However, the negative 2.51% monthly return on the average taxable-bond fund pales in comparison with the FBR fund's results. The average taxable bond fund is up 3.86% so far this year, through Friday.Patrice Milton-Blue, co-manager of the $29 million FBR fund, says the fund's recent decline wasn't a complete surprise given the portfolio's investment strategy, which combines holdings of U.S. government bonds with transactions in fixed-income options and futures. In time periods when the bond market is particularly volatile, which it has been in spades these past several weeks, the portfolio ""is going to be significantly more volatile than the market itself,"" Ms. Milton-Blue says.Still, some investors in the FBR fund might have been caught unawares by the fund's recent beating. The fund's prospectus says the manager uses options and futures in an effort to boost return or ""to protect the fund from adverse interest-rate movements."" That also was the way the use of those derivatives instruments was pitched to fund investors in late 2001, when the fund's adviser sought and obtained shareholder approval to modify the fund's strategy to include use of options and futures.",0,1.0,0.0,2188

449,"Cooling Off About Keeping Up; What's 'Competitiveness'?. A prominent journalist wrote in 1947: ""The basic power determinant of any country is its steel production, and what makes this a great nation above all is the fact that it can roll over 90 million tons of steel ingots a year, more than Great Britain, prewar Germany, Japan, France, and the Soviet Union combined."" Well, that was then. In 2005 the United States ranked third in raw steel production. Its output (95 million metric tons) was behind Japan's (113 million tons) and less than a third of China's (349 million). So?We are experiencing another competitiveness panic. These occur every 15 or 20 years. There's an outpouring of worried reports and articles. After Sputnik in 1957 -- the first artificial Earth satellite -- we were supposedly doomed to be overtaken by the Soviet Union. In the late 1970s and 1980s, it was Germany and then Japan. Lately, China and India have been the threats. Through it all, the United States has remained the dominant global economy, representing about one-fifth of the world's total output.If it means keeping the lead in every industry where we once led, we're doomed. As other countries develop, they create larger and better industries to meet their needs. Steel is an example. The United States doesn't need 350 million tons of steel. Textiles, consumer electronics and automobiles are other industries where we've lost ground to countries that have greater local needs, lower costs or better management. In many cases, U.S. multinational companies have relocated plants abroad to cut costs.Similarly, if competitiveness requires the United States to maintain its present share of the world economy, we are also probably doomed. We have recently maintained our share only because Europe and Japan have grown more slowly than the United States. But if China and India continue to grow rapidly, the U.S. share will shrink. The U.S. economy is now about $13 trillion; China's is about $2.2 trillion, says economist Nicholas Lardy of the Institute for International Economics. China's growth is 9 to 10 percent annually; the United States' is 3 to 4 percent. At those rates, China might pass the United States in 20 or 30 years, says Lardy. (However, per capita incomes in China would still be much lower.) The point: Global economic growth -- something the United States encourages -- erodes America's dominance. Technology, talent and wealth spread everywhere.One possible ""competitiveness"" definition is the ability of countries to stay ahead in developing new industries. Economists once saw land, labor and capital as the basic inputs of any economy. But they've now added ""knowledge,"" as David Warsh -- former economics columnist for the Boston Globe -- shows in his engaging book ""Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations.""

453,"Dollar Gains on Rise In Key Indicator; Gold Declines 50 Cents --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup. The U.S. dollar strengthened against major foreign currencies yesterday, partly in response to the larger-than-expected rise of 0.7% in February's U.S. leading indicators.Gold declined 50 cents an ounce in trading that was cut short by a New York snowstorm.Foreign-exchange traders said the February rise in U.S. leading indicators -- which suggest rapid economic growth in the months ahead -- more than offset the almost simultaneous announcement that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit last month widened to a record $10.09 billion. ""The fact that the leading indicators figure came out at about the same time as the trade deficit tended to blunt the effect of the latter,"" said Barry M. Wainstein, a vice president of BankAmerica International, New York.Although the foreign-exchange market had generally been expecting a smaller February trade deficit, said Bruce Pflaum, an assistant vice president and principal dealer of First National Bank of Chicago, ""a few people had warned that the deficit could reach to between $10 billion and $11 billion, so the market wasn't all that surprised by the number. But the rise in February's leading indicators was more than almost anyone had expected."" The general market expectation had been that the February U.S. leading indicators would advance by 0.2% to 0.4%.Both Mr. Pflaum and Mr. Wainstein also said traders purchased dollars yesterday to cover short positions. Those short positions stemmed from dollar sales on Wednesday that brought the U.S. currency down to 2.5713 West German marks in late New York trading that day.",0,1.0,0.0,596
454,"Got a Light?. As Christmas lights go up on homes around the country, you've probably noticed that the displays seem to get more elaborate every year. No longer does decorating a single evergreen in the front yard suffice. Every tree demands its own ropes of light, wrapping trunks and branches. Ubiquitous icicle lights drape even the most generic tract home in sparkling abundance. Arbiters of taste may clash over the merits of white versus colored bulbs, and energy Puritans may denounce the inessential use of electricity. But even stylistic snobs can't entirely deny the appeal of a thousand points of holiday light.Today's displays do more than brighten the night. They tell a story of economic progress. Like the electronic gadgets aimed at gift buyers, the tiny lights outlining roof lines illustrate new sources of growth and prosperity. Aesthetic pleasure, they tell us, is an increasingly important source of economic value and hence of new jobs and business opportunities. And the same trends that boost living standards in other areas also make Christmas lights more abundant. A holiday-lighting dollar goes a lot further than it used to. Homeowners buying Christmas lights benefit from the same intense competition that has driven down prices and improved reliability in so many other industries, raising our standard of living.When he was a teenager in the mid-'80s, David VanderMolen's job was to buy and install holiday lights for his family's Charlotte, Mich., home. Each year his parents would give him $10, enough for two 35- light strings, each 20 feet long, from Kmart. If the weather wasn't bad, a string would last three years. He eventually built up a collection of 350 light-strings, enough to make his house the most elaborately decorated in the neighborhood. Today, it would be nothing special. You can buy a 100-light string, 50 feet long, for $2.44 at Wal-Mart. Even without adjusting for inflation, that old $10 annual budget would cover more lights in a year than one could accumulate over seven years in the '80s. Today's cheaper lights, mostly made in China, also last longer.In our advanced economy -- in which innovation and competition are pushing the prices of goods ever lower and their quality ever higher -- it's more affordable than ever to make your house into a winter wonderland.Go ahead, light up your life.",0,1.0,0.0,3807

WASHINGTON -- Even as he trumpeted his plan to pay off the national debt by 2013, President Clinton quietly suggested an increase in the legal ceiling on how much debt the government can hold.Why? The answer lies in the difference between the debt held by the public and the total debt that the Treasury owes, which includes long-term obligations to other government agencies -- notably the Social Security trust fund -- for future benefits.Many economists consider the public debt, which the White House projects will decline to zero in 2013 from $3.48 trillion in the current fiscal year, to be the most important. That is what affects interest rates and the government's immediate impact on the broader economy. Mr. Clinton uses that measure when he talks of cutting up the government's credit card.But some analysts and politicians consider total government debt a better measure of the government's long-term responsibilities, and that figure rises as aging baby boomers stake an ever-bigger claim on Social Security benefits. Congressional limits on federal borrowing apply to that figure, not just publicly held debt.The current statutory debt limit is $5.95 trillion. For the current fiscal year, the debt subject to that limit will be safely below that figure -- about $5.65 trillion. But under the Clinton plan, government debt would cross the ceiling by hitting $6 trillion in 2004 and $6.79 trillion in 2013.",0,1.0,0.0,1140

But there could be an element of greed, too, as banks try to make up for losses on Third World loans.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board is keeping an eagle eye on the recent slide of the dollar. A depreciated dollar helps exports, but it has two negative aspects: it threatens new inflation stemming from the higher cost of imported goods, and it also can discourage the flow of foreign investment necessary to finance the national budget deficit. The Fed is walking a tightrope between the desirability of low interest rates to spur domestic expansion and higher interest rates to prop up the dollar.Unless he gets help on the deficit-control side from fiscal policy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan plainly warned in recent testimony, he may have no choice but to opt for higher interest rates.That could choke off an already tiring, six-year domestic expansion and confront the Bush administration with sudden recession.

Or at least, that's what executives at Stroh Brewery Co. figured. But Washington wasn't the setting originally proposed for a coming ad. ""The ad agency was going to shoot it in northern California and have some logs trucked in,"" says Hunter Hastings, vice president, brand management, at Stroh. He quickly vetoed that idea and insisted that the location be switched to Washington to avoid the expense of simulating a logging operation.Such a change might not have been demanded a year or two ago. But Stroh and other big advertisers have recently begun reining in their ad agencies in an attempt to control the volatile costs of producing TV commercials. ""The ad agencies are very much at fault,"" says Mr. Hastings. ""They want to win prizes for creativity and think the way to do that is to spend as much money as possible.""On average, the cost of making commercials surged 99% between 1979 and 1984, more than double the growth rate of the consumer price index, according to a recent study by the Association of National Advertisers. Fueling the increase: Elaborate special effects, greater use of music, more expensive cameras and lighting equipment and longer shooting schedules. The time required to produce a typical ad increased to 13.3 hours in 1984 from 10.1 hours in 1979, and most of that increase was charged as overtime. ""It's a constant tug of war,"" says Spencer Plavoukos, chief executive officer of the SSC&B ad agency. ""Clients want to spend less money for commercials, but they also want extravaganzas to stay ahead of one another visually."" SSC&B last month hired a production manager to help select directors and production houses that provide the best value for the money.PRODUCTION COSTS vary widely, but $100,000 to $200,000 isn't unusual for a 30-second commercial. So this month, American Cyanamid Co. executives visited two of their ad agencies -- Ted Bates and Dancer Fitzgerald Sample -- to show what they call ""the good-enough reel."" That's a tape of about a dozen commercials, the most expensive of which is $50,000.

Or Mattel, after its misguided $3.8 billion purchase of Learning Co. Or Quaker Oats, after its botched $1.7 billion acquisition of Snapple.The difference between a good deal and a bad one often boils down to little more than hubris, or just plain ego, which can cause a buyer to overpay.

It did say enough to convince some that the island's banking industry is in trouble.Some of the disclosures by Doral Financial Corp., which faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York, feed into a view held on Wall Street that several of Puerto Rico's banks are operated more like private clubs than public companies.

473,"The Flaw in Bush's Plan. The Bush budget policy continues to be awful. But the recent proposal for personal accounts in Social Security is at least half- excellent. If the administration can show the flexibility to recant one key error, it may deserve to win the coming battle in Congress.First, what's excellent? Unlike many versions of pension privatization, the Bush personal accounts are not a giveaway to Wall Street. The government would administer the personal accounts and control the short list of investment options, so salesmen would get no opportunity to push junk funds with enormous hidden fees onto unwary workers.The Bush plan is not a giveaway to account holders, either. Pension privatization in Britain, and the leading reform proposal from the Social Security commission in President Bush's first term, involved taxpayer subsidies to those who opted for personal accounts: A policy that was supposed to fix the future budget hole actually wound up enlarging it. The new Bush proposal, by contrast, is intended to be roughly budget-neutral (although more on this later). The new proposal also takes a decent shot at protecting investors from their own folly. Unless workers explicitly demanded otherwise, their savings would go into a ""life cycle"" account that shifts money from stocks to bonds as they get older. That way they're protected from a possible stock market crash on the eve of their retirement. Admittedly, some high-rolling 64-year-olds will still punt on equities and get burned. But millions of poor workers who accepted the default life-cycle option would retire richer.The leading reform proposal in Bush's first term said that individuals could set aside 4 percent of their pay (up to the payroll tax cap, currently $90,000) in personal accounts, but that the maximum anyone could set aside per year was $1,000. In his new proposal, however, the president added a promise to phase out that $1,000 cap. This may sound like an innocent change. But it turns a plausible plan into a crazy one.The phaseout kills the progressivity in personal accounts.

For better or worse, this chain of events greatly influenced the world economies of the past two decades.The largest lesson, correctly identified by Mr. Stein, is that the free marketplace found means to cope with these enormous economic changes. The first innovation -- the International Monetary Market in currency futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- will celebrate its 20th anniversary next spring.Come to Chicago today and you will see a major growth industry in financial risk management. With 130,000 related jobs and influence in financial capitals around the world, the futures and options business here has filled a dire need for managing risk-inflation, volatile interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates. ""Nixon's Worst Weekend"" was only the opening scene in a changed, shrinking and information technology-driven world that created not only risk, but also opportunity. The sequel is that, since 1982, global financial centers such as London, Paris, Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Frankfurt have established futures and options exchanges modeled on the example of the Chicago exchanges.With the luxury of hindsight, history inevitably judges policy decisions. As for the financial risks endemic to these decisions, they can be hedged with futures and options.John F. Sandner",0,1.0,0.0,4740

476,"Food Prices Likely to Get a Double Dose of Inflation from Gulf Crisis, U.S. Says. WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department warned U.S. consumers to brace themselves for a double jolt of food-price inflation this year and next because of the Persian Gulf crisis.Energy-price increases stemming from war jitters and the international embargo against Iraq already are beginning to drive up costs of growing, processing and distributing food, the department said. Most of the oil-price shock in the food sector, however, is expected to be felt in the first half of 1991.Department analysts said they expect food prices to average 5% to 7% higher this year than in 1989, a two percentage-point jump from the department's December 1989 prediction. The increase reflects not only the economic repercussions of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but also unrelated double-digit price increases on fresh fruit, pork, eggs and dairy products in the first half of 1990. Last year, food prices climbed 5.8%, the sharpest increase since 1981.The food-inflation forecast for 1991 won't be issued until November, but department analysts projected that oil prices alone will boost food prices 1% to 2% next year, primarily through higher transportation costs. However, they added that a further economic slowdown would relieve some of the upward pressure on food prices.At the same time, problems are brewing in the Farm Belt. Department analysts project a $1.7 billion jump in farm production costs if crude oil prices remain at $30 a barrel through 1991, and a $2.6 billion jump if oil hits $40 a barrel. Although farmers could find some savings by changing their production practices, net farm income is likely to drop in 1991, they said.",0,1.0,0.0,1162

While much of the country spent the first three months of 2014 sheltering against snow and ice, banks began to fire up the lending furnaces.That is welcome news for bank investors. Loan growth has been the missing ingredient for banks for some time. Without it, they have been left to try to bolster earnings through repeated rounds of cost cutting and reversals of loan-loss reserves, even as the Federal Reserve's superlow interest rate policy has weighed heavily on margins.While loan growth seen in the first quarter isn't yet strong enough to suggest banks are anywhere near out of the woods, it does provide some reason to hope the lending environment is improving. And it could bode well for banks' coming first-quarter results, especially as firms continue to grapple with lower mortgage-origination activity.Not that any lending gains have been immediately apparent. In the first quarter through the third week of March, the latest date for which Federal Reserve data are available, overall bank loans grew from a year earlier at an average of 2.5%.The pace is the same as seen in the final quarter of 2013.

To finance those purchases and others, the speculator was using cash generated by lending his stock.While ordinary investors can borrow no more than 50 percent of the cash needed to buy stock, Boesky was using stock loans to borrow several hundred percent of his cash outlay, a strategy regulators say was legal. In simplified terms, Boesky was able to do this by buying stock, ""lending"" it to other firms in exchange for cash, using that cash to buy more stock, lending out the new shares for more cash, and so on.Using debt to maximize his stock purchases-and his potential profits-was a key Boesky strategy, perhaps because his illegal access to inside information about deals increased his confidence about buying certain stocks.",0,1.0,0.0,1088

In the ensuing crisis, one-quarter of Chilean workers lost their jobs, wages regressed to levels not seen in a decade, and soup kitchens provided the only sustenance for millions of the impoverished. Within the depression, however, lay the seeds of Chile's current boom. Forced to look outward for new markets, Chilean companies turned into dynamic exporters, which today sell chopsticks to Japan, wine to Europe and machinery to the U.S.Chile's success in transforming a currency bust into an export bonanza underscores a widely overlooked silver lining in the recent Mexican peso crisis: The almost 35% devaluation of the peso could significantly accelerate Mexico's evolution as an export power, a process that was well under way when the country joined the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The Bundesbank favors ending the ECB's policy of draining funds from banks to offset its government bondholdings, a person familiar with the matter said.That would raise the amount of surplus funds in the banking system, the person said, and anchor money-market rates, thus providing a more stable environment for banks to lend.Consumer prices grew 0.7% in January from a year earlier in the euro zone, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said Friday, well below the ECB's target of just below 2%. That was down from 0.8% in December and short of economists' expectations for a slight rise. Some economists expect it to weaken further in February.Although January's figure wasn't far different from the previous month, it carries symbolic importance. The last time inflation fell so low, in October, the ECB responded with a surprise reduction in its key interest rate to a record-low 0.25%.

499,"Did FDR End the Depression?. 'He got us out of the Great Depression."" That's probably the most frequent comment made about President Franklin Roosevelt, who died 65 years ago today. Every Democratic president from Truman to Obama has believed it, and each has used FDR's New Deal as a model for expanding the government.It's a myth. FDR did not get us out of the Great Depression -- not during the 1930s, and only in a limited sense during World War II.Let's start with the New Deal. Its various alphabet-soup agencies -- the WPA, AAA, NRA and even the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) -- failed to create sustainable jobs. In May 1939, U.S. unemployment still exceeded 20%. European countries, according to a League of Nations survey, averaged only about 12% in 1938. The New Deal, by forcing taxes up and discouraging entrepreneurs from investing, probably did more harm than good.What about World War II? We need to understand that the near-full employment during the conflict was temporary. Ten million to 12 million soldiers overseas and another 10 million to 15 million people making tanks, bullets and war materiel do not a lasting recovery make. The country essentially traded temporary jobs for a skyrocketing national debt. Many of those jobs had little or no value after the war.No one knew this more than FDR himself. His key advisers were frantic at the possibility of the Great Depression's return when the war ended and the soldiers came home. The president believed a New Deal revival was the answer -- and on Oct. 28, 1944, about six months before his death, he spelled out his vision for a postwar America. It included government-subsidized housing, federal involvement in health care, more TVA projects, and the ""right to a useful and remunerative job"" provided by the federal government if necessary.",0,0.6577,0.34230000000000005,2587

501,"Ugly Modeling; Will spending cuts ruin or improve America's economy?. Author: Veronique de RugyFrom Reason MagazineIn February, the Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips predicted on ABCNews.com that a Republican proposal in the House of Representatives to cut $61 billion from the federal budget in fiscal year 2011, would, if enacted, shave two full percentage points off America's gross domestic product in the second and third quarters of this year. A few days later, The Washington Post described a new study by Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics and an architect of the 2009 stimulus package, a.k.a. the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Zandi's amazing verdict: The spending cuts would destroy 700,000 jobs by the end of 2012.After every newspaper had published the gloomy predictions, Goldman Sachs issued a ""clarification"" of Phillips' analysis. Phillips now says he was misunderstood by journalists eager to spread a doom-and-gloom message and predicts the impact of spending cuts probably will be mild and temporary. Perhaps he was influenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who testified in March at the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee that Goldman's numbers were incorrect.Yet even this correction implicitly assumes that government spending is the source of all recovery. The logic, as with Bernanke's and Zandi's analyses, is that government spending cuts reduce overall demand in the economy, which affects growth and then employment. This argument ignores the fact that the government has to take its money out of the economy by raising taxes, borrowing from investors, or printing dollars. Each of these options can shrink the economy.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004,3433
502,"Choose: Guns or Butter. On Aug. 3, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent a message to Congress in which he said that the United States could not continue to fight a war in Vietnam and at the same time continue his Great Society programs without, among other things, raising taxes. George Bush ought to read that message. It was titled ""The Hard and Inescapable Facts.""For Bush, facts are neither hard nor inescapable. He believes in ""magical math"" -- a firm understanding that somehow, in some way, something will happen to make everything come out right in the end. This is the economics practiced by the dreamy who think that today's credit card purchase will never come due. This, in a nutshell, is the financial blueprint for the United States of America.For Johnson, the realization that bills come due came too late. Early on he said, ""We can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam,"" but he sensed -- canny pol that he was -- that the American people would pay for the former but not, if they had to choose, the latter. When Johnson finally had to ask for a tax increase, he was on his way out as president. Less than a year after delivering his message about hard facts, he had to face the hardest one himself: He announced he would not seek reelection.Bush, having won a second term, cannot seek reelection and so he may never become politically accountable for his mismanagement of the nation's finances. As Johnson initially attempted, Bush is telling the American people they can have both guns and butter -- two for the price of one. In Bush's case, ""guns"" is the war in Iraq (and Afghanistan) and the ""butter"" is domestic programs such as enriched Medicare along with the war on terrorism, which Bush himself has characterized as virtually endless. In his case, though, he has not only refused to raise taxes, he has actually lowered them. LBJ could only marvel.Ever since the war in Iraq went from resplendent victory (""Mission Accomplished"") to the ugly quagmire it has become (almost 2,000 American dead), commentators have been making comparisons to Vietnam. I myself have done that -- and I think certain commonalities exist and are troublesome. Usually, these comparisons focus on military or political matters, but Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state and now a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, has found what may be a more apt comparison. Initially, both wars were financed on the cheap because interest rates were low.",0,0.6671,0.3329,1489

When electricity deregulation rolled out in Texas, private-equity shops were eager to get their hands on old-guard utilities suddenly capable of generating big returns.It looked like nothing but upside, but the $32 billion buyout of TXU Corp. was ""based on assumptions that didn't pan out,"" said Shalini Mahajan, credit analyst for Fitch Ratings who covers the company, now known as Energy Future Holdings Corp.The deal closed on Oct. 10, 2007, the day before the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its prerecession peak of 14,164. Not only did the buyers pay too much for the utility, they financed most of the deal with debt, creating an enormous repayment burden. They also managed to miss the change in U.S. energy markets.At the time of the buyout, the investors assumed electricity prices in Texas, an electrical island -- it has its own grid -- that can't import much power, would stay high for years to come. Before the recession, power prices in Texas were inflated because much of the state's electricity generation came from burning natural gas, an expensive fuel at the time.TXU was uniquely positioned to profit from high electricity prices because it made most of its electricity with coal or uranium, which were cheaper than natural gas. So it was able to collect prices for its electricity that were pegged to gas prices even though its actual costs were much lower.",0,1.0,0.0,1755

522,"Big Steel, Bad Gridlock. Washingtonians headed south this month, beware. The long, hot season of traffic congestion around Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens is in full swing. This year's tie-up has an interesting twist. A new Busch Gardens exit, including a bridge over Interstate 64, was supposed to open this summer but the project is a full year behind schedule. The exit will benefit tourists and residents by redirecting traffic from clogged roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation explains that its contractor faces a severe shortage of U.S.-made steel for the project.Federal ""Buy American"" laws forbid interstate highway projects with federal financing from using imported steel, even if there is no domestic steel available. The restrictions apply equally to the raw material (rolled beam) or the fabricated product (finished girders). A Northern Virginia contractor with whom I spoke said his supplier could use imported rolled beam for the contractor's private projects, but for federal roads projects such as the Interstate 95 exchange at Springfield, the domestic raw material costing 15 to 30 percent more was required. By expensively micromanaging his projects, his firm has steel. Others are scrambling. Guess who ultimately pays the extra cost.Buy American policies are nothing new, and they have a patriotic plausibility to most people. Who could be against saving American jobs? In many circumstances they are also innocuous. On the other hand, if they squeeze out imports as intended, they maintain higher prices to American steel users or cause them production delays waiting for backlogged orders to clear. This may save some jobs in favored industries like steel, but at a cost of sales and jobs in American industries that use steel. The benefits this policy provides to the protected steel workers and shareholders come directly out of the pockets of other Americans. This is income redistribution of the worst sort--from average folks to a group that earns substantially more than the manufacturing mean wage. In times of high unemployment, Buy American provisions conceivably can raise domestic demand, thus cushioning a cyclical downturn. But these discriminatory policies are hopelessly inefficient compared with Alan Greenspan's well-oiled monetary policy machine. By the way, has anyone checked the unemployment rate lately?What many people do not realize is that the most intense competition American firms face is not with foreign firms but with other American firms in markets for talented labor and scarce capital. Any policy that favors one set of American industries disfavors others. The most important possible exception to this is for policies that are designed to enhance innovation in ways that spill over to other American firms. Buy American policies are not directed toward research and development, and the steel industry is not at the cutting edge of technical progress.Highway construction contractors happily use Komatsu earth-moving equipment and a host of other imported products. So why is USX favored and Caterpillar not? The answer, of course, is lobbying power. A large industry spread across a number of important states often gets its way. Alas for the steel industry, its influence isn't what it used to be. The industry employs more than 400,000 fewer workers than it did in 1960. Small, modern mini-mills now provide almost half of domestic output. They have production costs substantially lower than the remaining large-scale integrated mills for which steel protectionism was designed.",0,1.0,0.0,4385
523,"Clustering Can Diversify a Real-Estate Portfolio. REAL-ESTATE INVESTORS may want to consider ""clustering.""That's one of the ideas being proposed in a new report by Prudential Real Estate Investors, the real-estate investment and advisory business of Prudential Financial Inc. The report aims to provide guidance on how to diversify a commercial real-estate portfolio more effectively.Conventional wisdom in the real-estate industry has been that diversification simply means having property in as many markets as possible or in every region. That way, when one market underperforms, it is offset by another market that is doing well.Prudential Real Estate Investors offers an alternative way of thinking about diversification -- one that isn't new but is gaining more mainstream acceptance. It proposes grouping the nation's 35 major metropolitan areas into clusters. Economic characteristics, geographic proximity and size all play a role in the clustering, with a strong focus on what the different markets share in common. Markets that have similar industries, for instance, are lumped into clusters rather than regions. The theory is that clustering and limiting investing to a few markets within a cluster reduces risk and redundancy in a portfolio.Investors could decide, for instance, that instead of being in Boston, San Francisco, Raleigh, N.C., and Austin, Texas, which are all tech-heavy markets, they can be in just two of those markets and that will be enough tech exposure.",0,1.0,0.0,537

Since stock futures were created in 1982, trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves.The conventional view, as voiced by Goldman, Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black, is that stocks and ""derivatives"" such as futures and options ""form a single market, and that derivatives make it a more liquid market.""But increasingly, people are questioning that view, and the critics include some of the country's most successful investors.

Three years ago, Maryland, like 43 other states, had a deficit driven by the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R), then a gubernatorial candidate, accused the outgoing administration of Parris N. Glendening of engaging in a ""scorched- earth spending spree."" Republicans called the Democratic governor ""Parris Spendening.""But what became of all that ""scorched earth"" spending? Did Ehrlich reduce ""Spendening"" spending levels? Hardly. If you accept the doubtful premise that Glendening's spending was ""scorched earth,"" then Ehrlich's spending has reached incendiary levels.When he left office, Glendening's final general-fund budget proposal was $10.4 billion. Ehrlich's baseline general-fund budget this year is expected to be $3.2 billion higher than that, an increase of almost one-third in just three years. During this period, Ehrlich has ignored state spending affordability guidelines.For years, Republicans in Maryland campaigned on the need to rein in state spending. Since Ronald Reagan was president, it has been a GOP shibboleth that government at all levels is riddled with ""waste, fraud and abuse."" But after three years in control of the governorship, Ehrlich's budgets implicitly acknowledge that state spending is not easily cut and that governments tend to spend what they take in.The initial Republican apologia for Ehrlich's spending will be to blame the Democratic legislature. This is a constitutional impossibility. Maryland's governors enjoy more expansive budget powers than any of the nation's 49 other state chief executives. With limited exception, no state spending can occur without first being proposed by the governor. The biggest exception has been mandated funding, such as the Thornton aid-to-education formula -- and Ehrlich declined to sign or veto that when it was presented to him for reaffirmation.",0,0.6675,0.3325,3199

Take this monthUas Post-ABC News poll. It shows, for example, that only 22 percent favor defense spending increases, while even fewerUOfrom 4 to 20 percentUOsupport cuts in domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and student loans. Since the presidentUas budget increases defense and cuts the latter, you might conclude that the voters are solidly against it.But there is something to the argument, usually made by administration acolytes, that voters are using Mr. ReaganUas programs as a baseline. They understand that defense has gone up a lot in the Reagan years, and, happy with that, see no need for it to go up much more; they have the sense that domestic spending has been cut, and are cautious about cutting it further. And certainly they come out on Mr. ReaganUas side on tax increases. By a 68-to-30-percent margin, they agree that taxes should not be increased to cut the deficit.Even granting all that, however, the poll does not support the White House position that the people really support the presidentUas budget, even if the politicians donUat. Mr. ReaganUas operatives are quick to argue that weli-connected lobbyists and well-positioned congressmen have kept in place many programs that the public generally doesnUat particularly want and for whose continued existence there are only the flimsiest of arguments. True enough. But added all together, these programs donUat amount to much.

Federal employment, after all, had declined substantially as a proportion of total jobs in the region during the Reagan years and metropolitan Washington had blossomed as a business center. The services sector had replaced government as the principal employer and, therefore, economic growth was being fueled by a burgeoning private sector in metropolitan Washington.That was the conventional wisdom of the 1980s. Not surprisingly then, a substantial decline in services-sector growth has shaken confidence in what was generally perceived as a services-driven economy. The psychological impact of the downturn was made worse by the general assumption that government employment and spending for goods and services no longer provided the safety net that it once did.

That could change, of course. But no matter what, the local economy will continue to be an important story in 1994.The Greater Washington Research Center may have provided a preview in mid-December when it suggested that the ""long-awaited"" expansion phase of the recovery will begin next spring as the negative forces that acted as a drag on the recovery lose their grip.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004,3116

In a $5 trillion economy, adding a percentage point to growth is a very big deal.Yet therein lies the seeming paradox for investors: Faster growth has not been a good friend to stocks in recent history.

He said he could get her an interest rate under 7 percent and told her to stop paying her mortgage because he would take care of that until the new loan came through, according to court papers.Several months and a confusing array of mortgage brokers later, the District resident ended up with a 30-year loan for $65,800 carrying a rate that varies from 11.49 percent to 18.49 percent. When she asked why the rate was so much higher than what she had been paying, she says, she was told it was because she had a bad credit record, brought on by her failure to pay her mortgage for the past three months--as the broker had instructed.Patrick says she signed the papers for the new loan out of fear she would lose her house.

I don't own a single share of Shawmut National Corp., but I made $1,700 in two days last week because Shawmut was gobbled up in a merger. How did I make money on a stock I've never owned? Easy. One of my biggest investments, Comerica Inc., was picked to take Shawmut's place in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and indexers began buying truckloads of Comerica shares. That produced a windfall for those of us who owned the stock.Welcome to the wonderful world of indexing. S&P announced last Tuesday evening that Comerica was joining the S&P 500. Comerica officially joined the index when the stock market closed on Thursday. By then, its stock had risen $2.12 1/2, a nice 6 percent jump from its Tuesday close. My 800 Comerica shares -- the biggest single holding in my retirement accounts -- were thus worth $1,700 more than they were two days earlier. In all, Comerica's shares gained about a quarter-billion dollars in market value.Had Comerica's prospects improved? Were its profits higher? Had some divine power alleviated the problems wracking Detroit, Comerica's hometown and biggest single market?Nope.

An early-retirement program set up four years ago has cost Virginia's government far more money than it saved, a new audit says, raising concern among some officials that the state may be heading down the same road this year with a round of worker buyouts.The 1991 retirement plan pared the state's work force by 3,535 employees and saved $37 million at a time when Virginia was hard-pressed to balance its budget because of the recession. But the state's independent auditor reports that so many of the jobs were refilled that savings in future years were negated.The report said that as many as two-thirds of the workers who left some of the state's largest agencies were replaced later, meaning that the state wound up paying for the positions even as its retirement system was saddled with $238 million in additional liability.The report comes at a time when Gov. George Allen (R) has embarked on an even more ambitious program to slash state government, not because of economic troubles but because of his belief that Virginia's bureaucracy has become too large and unwieldy.A buyout program that took effect this month will result in the voluntary departures of 5,470 employees -- about 5 percent of the state's payroll -- and Allen administration officials predicted today that the state would save $368 million during the next four years as a result.",0,1.0,0.0,763

563,"The Outlook: Unearthing the Underground Economy. WASHINGTON -- One of President Reagan's longstanding beliefs is that the government can reduce its deficit by mining uncollected revenues from the underground economy. The Treasury's proposal to simplify tax laws and lower income tax rates will get at some of the ""$100 billion of tax that is avoided in the United States"" each year, he contends.Over the last four years Congress and the administration have taken a number of steps to police tax evasion and slow the growth of the underground or ""off-book"" economy, where transactions often take place in cash and aren't reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury believes these actions already are starting to reduce tax cheating, although the IRS doesn't have much evidence to back this up yet. Reducing the complexity and perceived inequity of the tax system would increase compliance further, the Treasury argues. Virtue would be its own reward: A fairer tax system would boost economic efficiency and make tax evasion less attractive.The underground economy has intrigued economists and politicians since the mid-seventies, when some analysts began to notice a sharp increase in evidence of subterranean activity -- which ranges from dope dealing to a carpenter's failure to report income from moonlighting. Analysts theorized that the increase in unreported income was a response to rising inflation, which forced many taxpayers into higher tax brackets, and growing disenchantment with the complexity of the tax system.Since there's no uniform definition of the underground economy, economists disagree sharply about how to measure it and how to gauge its impact on the nation's output, employment and savings. Estimates of the subterranean economy's size range from 3% of gross national product, the value of the nation's output of goods and services, to 30%. The government's estimates tend to be at the low end of the range.While economists squabble over the size of the underground economy, politicians and tax collectors are unified in their desire to collect their share of these unreported revenue streams.

""If you work effectively, there's something in it for you,"" Ms. Wise says. ""That {incentive} wasn't always there before.""But three of 24 colleagues in her office weren't pleased at all. Although the office achieved 100% of its incentive-plan goals in the first quarter of this year, the three, including a man who had worked there for more than 20 years, didn't get any bonus money at all because their individual performance lagged behind the group's. That long-time employee eventually left the company, Ms. Wise says.Pay-for-performance can be ruthless, but it is nonetheless one of the hottest management and labor trends around, according to compensation consulting firms. Under such plans, middle- or lower-level workers are supposed to be judged as their high-powered executive bosses often are, receiving higher raises, bonuses or prizes for excelling on a variety of specific and often computerized measurement indexes. Employees who don't measure up receive little or no pay raise, or are even fired.A recent survey of 600 companies by Hay Management Consultants found that one-third intend to push pay-for-performance down the corporate ladder; about 11% currently do so. Another survey, by Hewitt Associates, finds a surprising surge in the use of incentive bonuses for all sorts of workers.",0,1.0,0.0,3162

The question testifies to his anxiety about what will happen after Dec. 31, when the United States pulls out the last of its troops and the Panama Canal comes under full Panamanian control.""I have great worries,"" said Gonzalez, whose cart occupies a busy street corner here. ""I have lost my sense of security. I have never known Panama without the Americans being here.""Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate.Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero.In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent.

But that once-stable relationship appears headed for the rocks as lenders increasingly fret over their exposure in the troubled industry.Last month's bankruptcy-law filing by Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and Armco Inc.'s near-bankruptcy only exacerbated already-strained ties between capital and industry.

But cheap foreign imports, high labor costs, obsolete hardware and the dwindling demand for steel have ravaged steelmakers, shattering their lenders' smokestack orientation.Although loans to the industry pale next to the enormity of Latin debt, steel industry bankers find themselves in vulnerable positions. Most major U.S. lenders already are carrying large portfolios of shaky foreign loans, and their capital-to-assets ratios scarcely meet federal regulatory guidelines.Money-center banks are reassessing major steelmakers as credit risks, while some lenders have turned to stronger producers such as Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp., a specialty-steel maker, and Pohang Iron & Steel Co. of Korea, a government-controlled producer.

Although no penalties were assessed against her, there could be fines for any future violations, according to the SEC.Under current securities laws, directors of publicly held companies must file forms notifying the SEC when they buy or sell stock in those companies.

The administration strongly opposes raising coverage from its current $100,000 per depositor per institution.The move jeopardizes competing proposals, one that passed the House overwhelmingly last year and has been reintroduced by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley (R., Ohio) this year, and another sponsored by Sen.

Both would boost the limit to $130,000 and index coverage thereafter for inflation.""Coverage increases pose a serious threat to taxpayers that could far outweigh the marginal benefits to depositors or the banking system,"" Mr. Shelby said after hearing testimony from the Treasury and the four federal banking regulators, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.Except for FDIC Chairman Donald Powell, all oppose increasing coverage limits, arguing it would encourage banks to lend recklessly with the taxpayer underwriting the risk.

The Montgomery County Council approved changes yesterday in the county's affordable housing program designed to create more moderately priced homes in a region where a hot real estate market has shut out many renters and buyers.The changes, the first major overhaul of the program in 30 years, could affect development particularly in downtown areas of Bethesda, Silver Spring, Wheaton and Rockville. To make it easier for developers to get financing for high-rises with below-market units, the council voted to allow more units on available land by relaxing height restrictions and green space requirements.The council also voted to increase the amount of time that below- market housing is required to remain in the program, so that the county can retain as many affordable units as possible as developable land dwindles. Rental units will have to remain in the program for 99 years, up from 20 years, and for-sale units will have to remain 30 years, up from 10 years.Council President Steven A.

""Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough,"" he said, chiding congressional critics who complained earlier in the year that the White House forecast was too optimistic.The administration acknowledged, however, that interest rates were likely to remain substantially higher than it had previously forecast.Mr. Sprinkel said the new numbers were consistent with a revised report from the Commerce Department, also released yesterday, showing first-quarter economic growth at a robust annual rate of 3.6%, after taking account of inflation. An estimate released last month put the growth rate in the ""real"" gross national product at 3.9%.The new forecast will be used to calculate the administration's midyear review of the budget. Mr. Sprinkel said that although the higher-than-expected growth will boost Treasury revenue, higher-than-expected interest rates will increase government spending on debt service.

Financial conditions have started to tighten sharply again.Or so says a new financial conditions index produced by a group of academic and Goldman Sachs economists*. And that's important, because financial conditions are a significant determinant of overall economic performance.Financial conditions indexes already exist. In fact there's a plethora that have been developed by investment banks and economic agencies or consultancies. They try to measure the degree to which changes in credit availability, interest rates, risk premia, money supply, wealth effects and other factors are likely to influence future economic activity. Analysis shows they don't work particularly well as predictors of real economic activity.The new index tries to get around these problems by, among other things, broadening the data series included and by trying to strip out the effects of past changes in economic activity that affect the financial variables. In other words, it's looking for evidence of financial shocks rather than the normally dynamics of financial indicators, which tell us plenty about the past but not a lot that's new about the future.Having done that, the new indicator diverges substantially from the existing ones.

624,"The Outlook: The Economic Impact Of Gramm-Rudman. WASHINGTON -- The Gramm-Rudman plan to balance the budget will test the resolve of politicians and the wits of economic policy-makers, particularly at the Federal Reserve Board. To meet the law's rigid schedule, Congress and the president will have to impose politically painful spending cuts and, many believe, tax increases. Gramm-Rudman also presents economic challenges. There are risks that sharp cuts in the deficit -- and the fiscal stimulus it provides -- could depress the economy. Many analysts believe the transition to a balanced budget will be a manageable, important step toward a stronger, more resilient economy, but it will be difficult.The stakes are high. ""In terms of potential economic ramifications, this bill has no rival save perhaps the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1929,"" Boston College economists Barry Bluestone and John Havens recently told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ""Gramm-Rudman mandates drastic cuts in the federal budget with the explicit purpose of reducing a string of $200 billion deficits to zero by 1991. How this Herculean task will be accomplished over the course of the next five years will ultimately affect every single measure of the economy. The rate of economic growth, the size of the trade deficit, the level of employment, and the distribution of income will all be profoundly affected depending on how this legislation is actually implemented.""The worst -- and least likely -- policy combination would be sharp spending cuts without any compensating ease in monetary policy. According to an analysis by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Inc. last fall, ""cutting the deficit to zero in 1991 using only spending cuts and assuming no offsetting stimulus, brings the economy to a grinding halt, pushing the unemployment rate to 17% in a few years,"" says Nariman Behravesh, a Wharton vice president.""Of course,"" he stresses, ""it's much more realistic to assume that such a huge cut in the deficit would be accompanied by significant monetary easing and a sharper decline in the dollar."" Thus, declining interest rates would spur investment and a lower dollar would boost U.S. exports, helping to offset the slowdown in spending.Mr. Behravesh warns that timing differences between the drag of spending cuts and the benefits from an easier Fed policy bringing lower interest rates could cause a temporary slowdown in growth and higher unemployment. But he argues that ""it's well within the realm of possibility to get through this period of adjustment without much pain and suffering and in the long run we'd be better off"" with an economy driven less by government spending and more by private investment and exports.",0,0.7043,0.2957,4163
625,"Falling Energy Prices May Bring Needed Boost to Ailing Economy --- Savings for Individuals, Firms May Free Tens of Billions For Additional Spending. NEW YORK -- The ailing U.S. economy could soon get a much-needed boost from an unexpected source: falling energy prices.Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some economists expected oil prices to rise on fears that a war in the Middle East would disrupt the supply of oil. Instead, prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have all fallen as concerns have grown that a possible global recession could drastically cut demand for energy.In the short run, those declines should act like a tax cut for consumers, freeing up funds for additional spending. They should also help cut costs at companies that have big fuel bills, including those in some of the hardest-hit industries, including airlines, trucking companies and manufacturers.In total, the recent declines could produce ""tens of billions of dollars in savings"" for companies and individual users of fuel, says Tom Robinson, senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.While that alone won't keep the country out of recession, it certainly will ""act as a salve in the wounds from the recession we're in,"" adds Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley.",0,1.0,0.0,105

TOKYO -- Japan announced broad tariff reductions including the elimination of tariffs on items such as auto parts and certain telephone equipment.But U.S. and Japanese officials said the impact of the reductions on Japan's trade surplus isn't likely to be large. What's more, they said Japanese officials are having trouble drafting a broader package of trade measures that is scheduled to be announced next month.Japanese officials said the latest tariff cuts are the broadest since a similar sweeping reduction in 1972. This time, tariffs were eliminated on 32 industrial products such as telephone exchanges, laminated automobile glass and aluminum airplane skins. Tariffs on about 1,800 further items were reduced about 20% each. The Japanese also announced a readiness to eliminate all tariffs on manufactured items if other leading industrial countries do the same. They said they currently are negotiating a reciprocal agreement with the U.S. to eliminate tariffs on computer equipment.Tokyo is trying to ward off anti-Japanese legislation threatened by the U.S. Congress. Japanese officials estimated that the tariff cuts could cost Japan as much as $400 million a year in lost revenue. They said the cuts required days of sometimes acrimonious infighting within the government and ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which is backed by business leaders and farmers here. But a U.S. official, asked whether the tariff cuts would affect the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, just laughed.""It isn't going to have a significant effect,"" he said, noting that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is likely to swell to $50 billion this year from $37 billion last year.",0,1.0,0.0,4117

Wait, I thought you told the SEC.Charter Communications Inc., the cable operator controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, is hitting bumps with an unusual issue of new stock tied to its sale last November of $862.5 million in convertible notes. Charter isn't shouldering its burden alone. The investors who bought those notes are right there with it.Selling the convertibles was a tall order to start with. The St. Louis company has more than $19 billion in debt, and bearish short sellers account for more than a third of Charter's publicly available stock. Ordinarily, hedge funds -- major buyers of convertibles -- would take a pass. These investors typically borrow a company's stock and short it as a hedge against owning the convertibles -- if the stock rises the convertibles become more valuable; should the stock fall, the short position pays off. But the huge short position in Charter stock makes it prohibitively expensive to borrow more of the stock to sell it short.So Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., the underwriter of the convertibles, came up with a twist. The bank lined up investors for the notes and got Charter to promise to issue 150 million shares of new stock that would be lent to Citigroup. Citigroup would turn around and lend the stock to the note buyers, enabling them to replace the expensive stock they borrowed to short Charter and thus comfortably lock in their hedge against the 5.875% notes, which mature in November 2009 and can be converted into Charter shares should the stock hit $2.42. (Charter shares traded at $1.23, up one cent, in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading yesterday.)Citigroup had a road map for doing this. Power giant Calpine Corp., another heavily indebted, heavily shorted company, last year sold $736 million in convertible notes tied to an issue of 89 million new shares. Calpine lent the shares to Deutsche Bank Securities, a banker on the deal, which lent them to hedge funds that bought the convertibles. The new stock issue wasn't dilutive because, under the terms of the deal, the shares will be returned to the company in 10 years when the convertibles reach maturity.",0,0.675,0.325,1346

With the Bush administration, one never knows what is intentional and what isn't, but the president's proposal to introduce private investment accounts into Social Security has certainly served to divert attention from whether the whole federal government is headed for a fiscal train wreck.That's probably a good idea, from the administration's point of view, because both it and many private employers are asking people to pin their retirement and other hopes for the future on financial assets. And they are asking this at a time when the government is promising benefits and services it can't come close to affording without taxing the fillings out of our teeth or going to banana republic-style inflation -- or both.It is a reality that David M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States, has been trying to point out to everyone who will listen and to those who won't.Walker is head of the Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency that studies government programs and policies and reports on how well or badly they are working.The costs of the three big social programs of our society -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- are rising so fast that by 2040 they and interest payments on federal borrowings will consume all the government's revenue, even assuming that the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire and that discretionary government spending (spending that is not already promised by law) grows only at the rate of inflation.",0,1.0,0.0,5075
643,"Border Patrol suicides cause alarm; Professional, personal reasons cited for more agents killing selves. After a bad day on the job as a Border Patrol agent, Eddie DeLaCruz went home and began discussing with his wife how to celebrate her upcoming birthday. Then he casually pressed his government-issued handgun under his chin and pulled the trigger.""It was the ugliest sound I ever heard in my life,"" his widow, Toni DeLaCruz, recalled of that day last November. ""He just collapsed."" A month later, one of DeLaCruz's colleagues at the Fort Hancock border post shot himself, too.Suicides such as these have set off alarms throughout the agency responsible for policing the nation's borders. After nearly four years without a single suicide in its ranks, the Border Patrol has had at least 15 agents take their own lives since February 2008.It's unclear why the agents killed themselves. Few of them left notes. And the agency seems somewhat at odds with itself over the issue.Federal officials insist that the deaths have nothing to do with the Border Patrol, which has doubled in size since 2004, or the increasingly volatile U.S.-Mexican border.

644,"Families Seeking Insurance For Kids; Downturn Forcing Parents to Get Aid. Rising unemployment and the sinking economy are driving sharp increases in the number of Washington area families seeking state health insurance for their children, and more of these families are qualifying for coverage, records show.The increases are particularly pronounced in the region's largest and wealthiest jurisdictions as employers cut benefits and eliminate jobs. In Fairfax County, for instance, requests for the state's insurance program for children, Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS), were up 16 percent between November 2007 and November 2008. In Alexandria, caseloads increased 20 percent, and in Loudoun, they were up 16.5 percent.Overall, caseloads in Northern Virginia shot up 18 percent during that period, from 19,299 to 22,692, compared with 7 percent for the rest of the state.In Maryland's Washington suburbs, caseloads for the state's insurance plan for children have increased about 4 percent, from about 45,000 to 47,000.Not only are caseloads up, but the number of people applying for such coverage has increased substantially too. Last week, the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services reported that the number of people applying for FAMIS increased an average of 24 percent a month in 2008 over 2007, from 5,073 a month to 6,291. This included a 40 percent increase in applications in September and October 2008 over the same two months in 2007.

645,"Indonesia Dollar Bond Sale Disappoints. Indonesia's attempt to sell bonds to local investors fell flat Monday, stymieing the government's effort to reduce the volatility of its currency.The Ministry of Finance had been looking to raise $450 million through its first-ever offering of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars to local investors. But weak demand for the bonds, with a coupon rate of 3.5%, meant the government was only able to raise $190 million--less than half its target.The bond sale comes as investors around the globe are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting back on its massive stimulus effort. Indonesian markets have been among the hardest hit by expectations the Fed will soon pull back on its $85-billion-a-month bond-buying program, a move that is expected to send U.S. interest rates higher and make emerging markets less attractive. Countries with both a fiscal deficit and current-account deficit, like Indonesia, rely heavily on foreign investment and can see their currencies plunge if investors flee.The debt sale was part of an effort to stabilize Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, which has already fallen by more than 20% against the dollar this year. The sale of the bonds was designed to increase the pool of dollars in the country to help meet local demand for the U.S. currency. Having more dollars on hand can help lessen the currency shock when foreign investors depart.Already, Bank Indonesia has raised its benchmark interest rate by a percentage point since late August, to 7.5%. Higher interest rates tend to draw overseas investors, and the move was widely seen as an effort to shield the economy from the turbulence that is expected when the Fed winds down its easy-money program.",0,1.0,0.0,4102

649,"Behind Cheaper Credit, Inflation Fears Loom. The Federal Reserve Board's rate cut yesterday increased the chances that months of Fed moves could start to trickle down to homeowners in time to ease the pain when adjustable-rate mortgages reset this year. And people who borrow money to pay tuition, buy cars or cover unpaid credit card bills might eventually see some benefit.But the Fed's action could also revive inflation, many economists fear. By reducing the interest rate financial institutions charge each other for short-term loans, the Fed makes money more readily and cheaply available. If it miscalculates, it can pump too much money into the economy, fueling excessive demand for goods, housing and capital spending -- and driving up prices.That would undermine Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's long-cherished notion of setting a low, narrow and predictable target range for inflation. Through higher consumer prices, all Americans would effectively help pay for the rescue of the financial industry. The decline in housing prices might be tempered, but inflation would eat away at real housing values.""The good news is that this will take pressure off of housing prices,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University. ""The bad news is that it will be very painful to squeeze the inflation out of the system when this mess is all over.""The threat of inflation was evident in commodity markets yesterday. Though at historically high levels, prices for corn and copper rose on the expectation that the Fed rate cut would breathe new life into the economy and avert a drop in demand.

In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls.Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990.

Instead, the real culprit is the big house.Hyperbole? Of course, it's hyperbole. But there is a nugget of truth here. Bear with me while I explain.-- More for Less: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, newly constructed single-family homes had a median size of 2,114 square feet in 2002, up from 1,520 square feet in 1982.

At first blush, it doesn't seem to be costing much at all. The reason: Even as homes have ballooned in size, interest rates have tumbled.To illustrate what a bonanza this fall in rates has been, consider the monthly mortgage payments on two homes, a smaller 1,520-square- foot house costing $130,544 and a larger 2,114-square-foot house valued at $188,141.

The attacks by Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad on Jews and by local radio personality Cathy Hughes on Hispanics occurred at different times and in different places and, on the surface, are completely unrelated.But defenders of both tirades have used similar twisted logic in justifying the attacks. Boiled down, their reasoning goes like this: Attacking an entire group of people is justified not necessarily because the targets are worthy of being excoriated but because the verbal assaults are a vehicle for inspiring blacks to help themselves.At Kean College in New Jersey late last year, Muhammad called Jews ""the bloodsuckers of the black nation,"" and said they control the Federal Reserve and the White House. He said Jews are known by such names as Rubenstein, Silverstein and Goldstein because they hoard rubies, silver and gold. Muhammad was later stripped of his position with the Nation of Islam by Minister Louis Farrakhan, who nonetheless said he basically agreed with what Muhammad said.On Jan. 26, Hughes, speaking to listeners of her WOL-AM radio station, said Hispanics have ""taken over"" parts of Washington along 14th Street NW.

A second-year Harvard Business School student wants $15,000 for foreign travel and gets a loan at 8%. A stepmother in suburban Sacramento needs $4,000 to cover the legal expenses of adopting her stepson and gets a loan at 23.75%.These three borrowers have one thing in common.

668,"WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Where to Invest in an Era of Risk. It is time for investors to rethink safety.Until May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that the central bank might start scaling back its massive bond-buying program this year, investors could find shelter from market drops via bonds or stocks that pay high dividends and are less volatile. But since then, it is these same ""safe"" investments that are being punished the most.The beauty of assets traditionally perceived as ""safe"" -- or, more correctly, defensive -- was that, while they didn't gain as much as risky assets in boom periods, they offered investors some protection in times of turmoil.This past month's roller-coaster ride has offered a preview of how the next few years might be different.Since Mr. Bernanke's May statements, the yields of most kinds of bonds have shot up, sending prices off a cliff. The yield of the 10-year Treasury stood at 2.49% on Friday, up 1.1 percentage point since the 52-week low of 1.4% in July 2012, though down about 0.1 point from its June 25 high.",0,0.6727,0.32730000000000004,2043

Investors sold off gold for the first session in four, and Treasurys fell, lifting yields to a two-week high. Yields rise when prices fall.The stock gains helped the Dow recover some of the losses incurred last week, when the blue-chip index dropped more than 260 points, its worst week since August.That drop was driven by worries that tensions in Libya, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world would push oil prices higher, fueling inflation and squelching the U.S. economic recovery. It also coincided with a consensus among investors that the market was due for a pullback after the powerful stock rally since late August.But many investors are starting to believe the U.S. economic recovery is resilient enough to withstand triple-digit oil prices, especially with the Federal Reserve still propping up the economy.

670,"Obama's Factory Factor. Just as the ghost dance of the Sioux failed to bring back the buffalo, so the declining dollar and the high price of gas have failed to bring back American manufacturing. To be sure, with the dollar down, exports are up, and with the price of shipping goods from Shenzhen to Los Angeles rising with the cost of oil, Chinese imports have slowed. Nonetheless, as the New York Times' Louis Uchitelle reported Monday, most of the rise in U.S. exports has come in corn, wheat and other agricultural commodities, not in aircraft or machinery.Will America ever get its manufacturing back? Not unless we move to level a steeply tilted playing field: China and a host of other nations offer generous subsidies to companies locating their plants there, while the United States shuns such mercantilist strategies. But even if we moved toward mercantilism, we'd still have to confront the global economic order of the past quarter-century. American banks and corporations have already made immense capital investments, bringing their technology and expertise to nations with far cheaper workforces. There's no evidence that they've hedged their bets with contingency plans to reinvest in Ohio.Besides, once you shutter enough factories, reopening or rebuilding them -- and their equivalently shuttered supplier and transportation networks -- is no simple matter. Nor is reacquiring skilled crafts workers in industries such as precision machine tool manufacturing, which have largely been offshored. Two years ago, I interviewed J. Bradford DeLong, a Berkeley economist who had served in the Clinton Treasury Department, for the American Prospect (a magazine of which I'm an editor). He expressed concern that American manufacturing had a tipping point after which, if it were cut back far enough, it might not be capable of again becoming an export engine that fueled national prosperity. ""I worry that a lot of manufacturing capacity we could get back now we may not be able to get back in a couple of years,"" he said. It's looking now as if he was right.The problem with the decline in manufacturing isn't simply that it has helped turn us from an exporting, creditor nation to an importing, debtor nation. It's also that manufacturing jobs tend to pay more than the service and retail jobs that have replaced them. The loss of several million manufacturing jobs during the Bush presidency coincides with the first economic recovery in American history in which the average family's income actually declined.As it happens, the Americans most affected by these changes are the Americans most able to sway the outcome of the presidential election: the beleaguered workers of our onetime industrial heartland. Barack Obama can claim the allegiance of the black workers so affected, but it's the white workers clustered in these swing states who will determine our next president.",0,0.6662,0.3338,405

The Senate asked itself yesterday whether it wants to use any ""peace dividend"" to reduce deficits, increase spending or cut taxes. The answer was yes.In the opening of what is expected to be a long, contentious and highly political debate on the issue, the Senate indicated in two nonbinding resolutions that its first priority is deficit reduction and that it puts spending on ""urgent national priorities"" only barely ahead of tax cuts.But mainly, yesterday's votes demonstrated that the issue is far from resolved and underscored the political opportunities and hazards that face both Democrats and Republicans as they attempt to deal with the fiscal fallout from peace and reap the political rewards.The debate signaled agreement among many conservatives as well as liberals that there will be at least some peace dividend, although probably relatively small at the start, as easing of East-West tensions causes reductions in military spending. But there was little agreement on the size of the windfall, and the Senate came perilously close to saying it should be used for everything.The early test of wills on the peace dividend issue began when Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) proposed a ""sense of the Senate"" amendment urging that any savings left after deficit reduction targets are met be ""returned to America's taxpayers"" in the form of tax cuts.",0,0.695,0.30500000000000005,4160

Mexico said yesterday that it had lined up more than $20 billion in loans and lines of credit that it might tap in an effort to ensure economic stability during next year's presidential election.The loans, which include some that were previously pledged and others that renew existing credit lines, come from the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. and Canadian governments, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. The money is aimed at keeping President Ernesto Zedillo's six-year term from ending the way nearly all of his recent predecessors' terms have ended -- in a panicky flight by investors and lenders fearful that the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. In many past election years, the government has gone on spending binges aimed at winning support for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.""This will provide us with the conditions necessary to have an orderly economic transition at the end of the six-year administration,"" Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of Mexico's central bank, said at a news conference in Mexico City.The move comes amid nervousness in financial markets that next year's elections, which are expected to be hotly contested, could be afflicted by the sort of political instability, economic mismanagement and capital flight that caused the peso to plunge in 1994, weeks after Zedillo's electoral victory. The peso crisis rocked global markets and prompted the Clinton administration to lead a $50 billion bailout for Mexico that sparked criticism on Capitol Hill.The administration, the IMF and their allies contend that this time around, Mexico is in much better economic shape and will use its international support to buttress sensible policies. The government has won praise from economists for keeping its budget and trade deficits under control, and Zedillo has sworn to keep from repeating the mistakes of his predecessors.

The U.S. Postal Service and the country's largest mailers are close to agreeing on a compromise that would boost postage rates as soon as June but stave off an even bigger increase threatened by the post office in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the recession.The deal, which includes accepting the Postal Service's proposal of late September to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents, follows two months of negotiations aimed at avoiding skirmishes that usually cause the rate-setting process to drag on for about a year.The settlement calls for the higher rates to take effect at least three months earlier than the October implementation the Postal Service originally projected, giving the agency a much-needed revenue infusion. The agency reported a $1.7 billion loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2001, and it has predicted a similar result for the current fiscal year.The compromise still must clear several hurdles and could fall apart if not enough of the 58 companies, industry groups and other parties in the pending rate-increase case support the deal.

Perhaps before we get in too deep, it would be helpful to tune out the demagoguery and listen to what leveler heads say on the central issue here: free trade.The first level head, Ronald Reagan, discusses Nafta nearby (see related article: ""Tear Down the Trade Wall"" -- WSJ Sept. 13, 1993). We'd like to talk about Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the great economists who laid the groundwork for our understanding of the West's spectacular rise to prosperity. Mr. Ricardo was a Jewish stockbroker who married a Quaker, made a fortune in the stock market and retired young to think about economics. Mr. Smith, the author of ""The Wealth of Nations,"" needs no introduction.Messrs. Smith and Ricardo first sketched out the idea that 200 years later remains an article of faith among economists. The idea is called comparative advantage. It says: Let us each specialize in the production of what we're good at, and then trade the fruits of our labor.Consider Joe Sixpack, who makes his living fixing cars. With the money he earns, he pays other people to grow his food, assemble his refrigerator and program his Gameboy. Nobody would advise Mr. Sixpack to knock off early at the auto shop and grow his own corn. He can enjoy more of everything by fixing more cars, which is his comparative advantage.Notice that it doesn't matter at all to Mr. Sixpack that his Gameboy was programmed in Japan and his frijoles were grown by a Mexican. Adam Smith put it this way: ""If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.""",0,1.0,0.0,4518

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday sold the last toxic assets it acquired from the bailout of American International Group Inc., closing the book on its most controversial intervention during the financial crisis with a large gain to taxpayers.The regional Fed bank said it reaped $6.6 billion in profits from selling complex mortgage securities that it took on in late 2008 to stem AIG's cash bleed. The securities, known as collateralized debt obligations, were chiefly responsible for the New York-based insurer's near-collapse and government bailout after their market values plunged during the financial crisis.The sales end one of the most contentious elements of the government's efforts to stabilize the financial system as markets were seizing up and banks and other financial institutions were collapsing.

In a high-stakes race to bring a new type of cancer drug to market, two companies have gained important ground after the leading company, ImClone Systems Inc., failed to clear regulatory hurdles.To get to the market quickly, ImClone tried a high-risk strategy to seek regulatory approval with one small, unusually designed clinical trial. But the Food and Drug Administration in December refused to review its application. The resulting mess -- a rash of shareholder lawsuits, embarrassing publicity, and investigations by Congress and regulators -- has been a nightmare for ImClone and its officers and directors.But ImClone's stumble may have created an unexpected opportunity for AstraZeneca PLC and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the multibillion-dollar market for this new class of cancer drugs.

Most solid-tumor cancers -- colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and head-and-neck -- appear to grow using the chemical signaling the medicines aim to block.

679,"Don't Blame Subprimes; Those Bad Loans Were Just a Response to Our Real Problem. I am sick of everyone blaming the breakdown in the credit and housing markets on subprime loans. Subprime loans were certainly part of the problem, but they are a symptom of a deeper issue. What's happening in the market today is not the bursting of a five-year bubble but the bursting of a 40-year bubble and the failure of the mortgage loan system to meet the needs of the marketplace.The truth is that subprime lenders, by responding to demand, were the finger in the dike for the whole housing market. The real problem is affordability and the incongruity between incomes and home pricing.Forty years ago, the median national price of a house was about twice the median household income. In some parts of the country, this ratio was closer to 1 to 1. Twenty years ago, the median home price was about three times income. In the past 10 years, it jumped to four times income.But in most major economic centers, typical families haven't been able to buy a home for anything near the national median price for decades. Try to find a single-family home in the D.C. area for the national median of $221,900. In the major markets, there is tremendous dependency on alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which in turn has created a dependency on the least scrupulous mortgage companies and lenders.The issue of affordability is not news to the major players in real estate. Each month, lenders, developers and government agencies study the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index. This index provides a way to track whether housing is becoming more or less affordable for typical households nationwide; it incorporates changes in key variables such as home prices, interest rates and incomes.",0,1.0,0.0,1915

Consider that he observed that if all economists were laid end to end, they could not reach a conclusion. Someone else modified that wisdom to note that if all economists were laid end to end, they would point in all directions.Can any of us disagree? Take, for example, what is being said about the proposed gasoline tax. Every guy who can correctly spell ""John Maynard Keynes"" is now on his soapbox, making totally contradictory pronouncements about the much-discussed possibility of a gasoline tax to reduce the federal deficit. A goodly number are saying that a 15-cent-a-gallon federal tax on gasoline (added to the present 9.1 cents) would knock about$15 billion off the debt in a reasonably painless way. Another group is saying that such a tax is inflationary and unfair to low- income groups and to drivers in western states who have to run longer distances for the necessities of life. Others are in concert with George Bush, simply moving their lips in a doctrinaire opposition to taxes of any kind.So what should be done? Regardless of what the boys in the White House think, a whole lot of folks here inside the Beltway think a tax on gasoline is inevitable, but only if the Democrats in Congress can generate enough guts to pass such a levy and then stand the heat of the sure-to-come presidential veto. That means they get saddled with the mark of Cain as the ones who jacked up the taxes-to save the nation from financial ruin-over the dead bodies of the gallant Bushies. But so what? Is it possible that just once Congress could exhibit a little political courage in the name of the national good?We need a higher tax on gasoline. We would need it even if the national debt were zero. We would need it even if we were $176 billion in the black. Why? Because national priorities transcend simple dollars. As in keeping this planet from turning into a gaseous little hothouse. We are fouling our atmosphere at a sinful rate, and something has to be done to reduce our irrational dependence on fossil fuels of all kinds. (Yes, we need revised taxes on all sorts of energy consumption, but that is a broader question that must be addressed as part of a comprehensive energy policy.)Advocates for a simple gasoline tax increase include conservative economists like Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker as well as liberals like Felix Rohatyn and Lester Thurow. Opposing them are heavy-duty highway-user interests and such pressure groups as Fuel Users for Equitable Levies, or FUEL for short. They claim that truckers, commercial interests, low-wage earners and folks from states like Wyoming would be unduly penalized by the tax.

The District government should significantly reduce real estate taxes and cut personal and corporate income tax rates so it can attract new employers to the city and keep the ones it has, a broad-based business coalition recommended yesterday.The tax recommendations were part of a sweeping series of proposals to improve the District's business climate, which generally is perceived by government officials and business leaders as worse than in surrounding jurisdictions.Private-sector leaders long have complained about the high cost of operating in the District, but yesterday's 38-page report is the most comprehensive effort yet undertaken by the District's private sector to identify problems and propose solutions.The report was written by the Washington Committee, an ad hoc group of more than 240 people who spent the last three months formulating the recommendations. Though most of the Washington Committee comes from business, members also represented nonprofit organizations and several arms of the District government.The tax proposals were accompanied by a call for reductions in the D.C. minimum wage, unemployment benefits and workmen's compensation insurance.

WASHINGTON -- College tuition is still rising faster than inflation, increasing 4.4% at public four-year colleges and 5.2% at private four-year schools.Average tuition at public schools in the 2000-2001 academic year was $3,510, while at private schools the tab was $16,332, the College Board said in its annual report on college pricing.College Board President Gaston Caperton called the increases ""modest,"" and said inadequate academic preparation is a greater barrier to college admission than cost. But the tuition increases outpaced both the 3.5% annualized increase in the consumer price index for the first eight months of this year, and year-earlier price increases.The College Board said student aid rose 4% to $68 billion, but the aid data lag behind the college-cost survey by a year.Room-and-board costs increased by an average 5.1% to $4,960 at public colleges and by 4.2% to $6,209 at private schools.

693,"The Economy -- Capital: Struggling Stocks Threaten the Economy. FOR A TIME, there was a reassuring story to tell about the stock market and the economy. Stocks rose in a speculative frenzy, and then fell. But the U.S. economy recovered surprisingly quickly from Sept. 11, aided by the irrepressible American impulse to shop, plus a round of interest-rate cutting. The market was sick. The economy wasn't. Silicon Valley paper millionaires stopped buying Porsches. The rest of us kept buying Chevrolets.The magnitude, the speed and the circumstances of the stock-market decline are threatening that comforting story. Unless the market touches bottom soon -- and despite yesterday's spectacular bounce in stock prices, there is no assurance of that -- it is going to yank the economy down with it.We may not sink back into recession. But if we have a few more bad weeks on Wall Street, you can rip up those forecasts about the economy growing at a 3.5% annual pace in the second half. Instead, the economy will slow so much that unemployment starts climbing again and the much-delayed resumption of business capital spending will be delayed still further.History offers lots of lessons at a time like this. It's just hard to tell which ones to apply. After the 1987 stock-market crash, consumers paused for a bit, but the economy barely faltered. In 1998, the stock market dropped, and two fantastic years followed. Seven of the 14 bear markets since 1929 didn't coincide with recessions. But seven did, and the damage that a bursting bubble did to Japan is a reminder of how badly things can go awry even in a wealthy, modern economy.The economic fundamentals in the U.S. are still strong. The White House and Alan Greenspan are right about that; they aren't mindlessly reciting Herbert Hoover's memoirs. The very resilience of the U.S. economy, so far, has been impressive.

Last week, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee approved the raise as part of a $90.6 billion spending bill for the Transportation and Treasury departments and several small agencies.

697,"The Afternoon Report: Killing Merck's Pain?. Drug maker Merck is hoping it can reenter a lucrative market for arthritis painkillers, but comments from regulators today suggest it faces long odds, just as a number of analysts suspected.Merck's Arcoxia, like the company's shelved Vioxx, is a Cox-2 inhibitor, designed to reduce the gastrointestinal damage that other painkillers may cause. However, The Food and Drug Administration said in a memo posted on its Web site that new drugs in that class should fill an unmet medical need for patients who have no other ""relatively safer"" means to manage their arthritis pain. The agency also noted that it ""remains uncertain"" as to whether most Cox-2 drugs deliver their purported gastrointestinal benefits -- it said only Pfizer's Celebrex, which remains on the market, has been shown to reduce bleeding. Vioxx was yanked off the market in 2004 after it was linked to increased cardiovascular risks, and Merck soon found itself facing thousands of lawsuits from consumers. (The drug maker has vowed to fight each claim, and it has had a mixed record in state and federal trials so far.) Under great political pressure, the FDA put ""black box"" warnings on Cox-2 inhibitors in 2005. Since then, Merck has been looking for a way to recover at least some of the $2.5 billion in annual sales Vioxx produced in 2003, its last full year on the market.An outside panel of medical experts will vote Thursday on whether they think Arcoxia, which is already being sold by Merck overseas but fetched relatively small sales of just $265 million last year, should be given the green light by the FDA. The agency isn't bound to follow the experts' advice, though it frequently does. Many Wall Street analysts believe that Arcoxia's chances for approval are slim. Jason Napodano of Zack's Equity Research sees ""a near-term U.S. launch of Arcoxia as highly unlikely."" He thinks that regulators, who took a lot of heat over their approval of Vioxx and other Cox-2 inhibitors after word of the heart risks emerged, will be ill-inclined to stick their necks out on the drugs this time. ""We believe the FDA would be highly criticized for approving Arcoxia given the past cardiovascular risks seen with the class and the new hypertension and edema risks"" shown in a trial of the drug, Mr. Napodano noted. Many analysts aren't even bothering to build Arcoxia into their projections for Merck.Merck remains upbeat about its outlook and even recently bumped up its profit estimates for this year. Though it's eager to replace its lost Vioxx sales, the drug giant isn't putting all of its eggs in one basket. It boasts a strong roster of newer drugs which should help to offset the large piles of cash that the company is shoveling into Vioxx litigation, as well as the loss of patent protection on the blockbuster cholesterol fighter Zocor. Among those medications is Gardasil, a vaccine for the cervical-cancer causing human papillomavirus. Merck ditched a much-criticized campaign to make Gardasil vaccinations mandatory for young girls, but Mr. Napodano thinks that it ""will be a blockbuster for Merck"" anyway. Wall Street also has high hopes for just-approved diabetes drug Janumet. Jami Rubin of Morgan Stanley, who lifted her price target on Merck from $53 to $55 today, projects it will fetch $2.8 billion in sales by 2011. Merck, which reports earnings next week, saw it shares rise slightly today, to around $46 a share, just shy of its 52-week high of $46.55.---",0,1.0,0.0,4841

702,"Middling Kingdom. Jasper Becker is Beijing bureau chief for a Hong Kong newspaper, the South China Morning Post, which covers China more extensively than any other English-language paper does. Reporting from China most of the time since 1985, he has been everywhere and asked every question. A few years ago he published a well-regarded book on China's great famine of the 1960s. Now he has pulled together much of his own reporting and that of his Post colleagues to offer a corrective to the outside world's generally sunny view of China today.Becker focuses first on poverty-stricken minority peoples living in regions distant from the coast and on peasants in hilly and dry regions. Then he moves chapter by chapter to the cities, and up the ladder from factory workers to private entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and finally the top leaders. As he gets closer to the coast and to Beijing, he brings consumerism and intellectual sophistication into view. He emphasizes how recent China's consumer revolution is, and throws doubt on the argument that the Internet and faxes will pry Chinese society from the grip of the authoritarian state.A common view in the West -- and a principle behind the China policies of both Bush pe{grv}re and Bill Clinton -- was that economic opening and growth would improve human rights in China. Becker shows that this optimism has been largely unjustified. Beneath the back- slapping, banqueting and cell-phone networking of private-enterprise China he sees the pathologies of a sick society: unemployment, nepotism, corruption and political repression. Many Chinese are worse off, even though GDP per capita has increased. The welfare system has collapsed, the state enterprises are even hollower than they're commonly understood to be, workers have lost job security, and the traditionally dismal terms of trade between the countryside and the cities have worsened. Private entrepreneurs flourish at the sufferance of the state but fall victim to predatory officials and shifts in government policy, and even on the most optimistic projections cannot create enough jobs to soak up China's surplus labor power. Police repression has tightened: The individual freedoms bruited in the West are restricted to matters of lifestyle, which do not include politics or religion. ""The 600 million Chinese peasants,"" says Becker, ""are the largest unenfranchised group in the world.""Becker's reporting is at its best where China is at its worst. Even among specialists, I do not think the collapse of China's health system has been portrayed as incisively as Becker does it here. He is convincing on the sorry state of rural education, although I think he underestimates strengths at the university level, and he is scathing and correct on the often overpraised reforms of the justice system.Some details Becker gets wrong. It's not fair to say that ""China has annexed the South China Sea"" or that ""China acts as if it has no international obligations other than to ethnic Chinese."" It's not true that the National People's Congress has no permanent staff or offices or that Deng Xiaoping had no official post in 1989 except chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association (in fact, Deng's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission was crucial to his role in the events of that year). The prediction that Taiwan will help fund the Chinese democracy movement and hence determine China's future strikes me as misguided in two ways -- because the Taiwanese avoid involvement in mainland politics, and because change is more likely to come from within the ruling Communist Party than from the dissident movement.",0,1.0,0.0,285
703,"A New Wave of Environmental Laws Looms. Jan. 20, 1989 will mark the onset of a flood of new health, safety and environmental regulation that will swamp that of the early 1970s. Impossible? Didn't regulation dry up in 1980 with Ronald Reagan's mandate to ""get the government off our backs""? To be sure, Watt, Burford & Co. attempted to curtail regulation, or at least to cork the flow. But they soon departed as liabilities, leaving the agencies with ""technocrat"" administrators and instructions not to antagonize either the public or business.For six years Mr. Reagan has focused on taxes, the budget deficit and defense expenditures. Inattention has not solved the health and environmental problems. Six years of accumulating pressure is about to explode: The majority of Americans continue to want something done about toxic waste dumps, water quality, air pollution and occupational hazards.No one should doubt the political appeal of these issues. Congress delayed adjournment and campaigning for reelection to pass the Superfund and Drinking Water Acts. Overwhelming majorities voted for laws that will impose major costs, that could be used to halt industry and that will do little to improve health or the environment. The bills focus on unrealistic worst cases and hypothetical risks, and embody unattainable goals; they divert attention from pressing environmental problems such as radon in homes. Just before an election, Mr. Reagan could have tested his 1980 mandate, vetoing burdensome, unsound legislation. If he had, the Republican Senate was ready to override.Separately, he did veto an egregious pork-barrel ""clean water"" bill that included sewer projects. It's a good bet Congress will put that one over the top when it reconvenes.Looking ahead to 1988, will presidential candidates tell the voters in New Hampshire that Mr. Reagan was right to do nothing about acid rain except some ill-focused research?

That other guy -- or gal -- will be the next president of the United States.To be sure, in many ways the federal budget is in better shape today than it was in Mr. Stockman's day. As a share of the economy, federal outlays and receipts were smaller last year than in fiscal year 1982. Because outlays fell more than receipts, the federal budget deficit amounted to only 1.2% of GDP last year, down from 4% in 1982. In fact, if the economy grows as projected and Congress maintains current tax laws and spending policies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a federal budget surplus by 2012.That's the good news. Nevertheless, our next president will encounter three ticking tax bombs in the weeks following the inauguration, as he or she prepares the budget for fiscal year 2010. Should even one of them detonate, we all will suffer the consequences.The first ticking bomb is the fate of the Bush tax cuts. CBO's optimistic federal budget surplus projection is based on the assumption that Congress will allow the president's tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. That would trigger the largest tax increase in history (nearly $1.9 trillion over seven years), raising taxes on 115 million taxpayers, and returning to the tax rolls 7.8 million low- and middle-income families who now pay no federal income tax because of the Bush tax cuts.If this bomb explodes, one thing is certain: It will damage the economy.

But notUOat least not in a systematic way-on inflation.The major speech prepared on inflation was never given, and an eight-point program based on the speech and' released on the campaign plane was almost universally ignored. So it is not surprising that businessmen are nervous and there is a tendency to see a collision shaping up between the President-elect and the sagacious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Arthur Burns.But in fact an analysis of the original speech shows that Carter takes the inflationary problem seriously indeed. It seems equally clear that Mr. Burns, far from seeking a shoot-out with the new administration, is moving toward a position of accommodation.The basic premise of the original speech prepared for Carter is that inflation is a deadly serious problem. UICurbing the disease of inflation will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next President of the United States,U is its opening line.

NEW YORK -- This isn't fur-buying season, but buying fur retailers seems to be getting trendy.Centaur Partners II, a Bethesda, Md., investment partnership, said last week that it has amassed 25.6% of Fur Vault Inc. and may buy more. Just last month, a group of Canadians in the fur business bought a controlling interest in Antonovich Inc., another of the small handful of public fur retailers.Fur-industry experts say the buying activity in the two firms, while unrelated, indicates that the business may be poised for profitability after several dismal years. In 1987, retail demand was strong and skin prices soared, but after the stock market crashed in October, sales plummeted and many fur stores were left with bloated -- and expensive -- inventories. Both Fur Vault and Antonovich posted losses two years in a row.Melvyn J. Estrin, one of Centaur's partners, said in an interview, ""We believe this is an undervalued stock."" Fur Vault went public in 1984 at $11 a share and got as high as $15 in 1987, but it has been languishing lately at about $2.50. Centaur has been buying the stock for as much as $4.50 a share and now has 3.2 million common shares. Fur Vault shares fell 12.5 cents to $3.875 Friday in American Stock Exchange composite trading.Mr. Estrin described Centaur's intentions as ""friendly."" He added, ""We've had some discussions with Fur Vault and would like to get some positions on the board and help with input on the future of the company.

Gobblepalooza!Such hyperventilation has become par for the course on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. That one day accounted for nearly $11 billion in sales last year, according to research firm ShopperTrak.But as the country stumbles toward economic recovery, one short day is apparently no longer enough to win the hearts and minds - and wallets - of American consumers, particularly when retailers rely on holiday shopping to ring up as much as half of their annual sales. In recent years, the industry has filled the calendar with a slew of new landmark shopping days to keep consumers fired up right through Christmas.There is Small Business Saturday, started by American Express this year to send customers to those long-suffering mom-and-pop shops. Then comes Cyber Monday, created by a trade group, when we return to work after Thanksgiving and collectively slack off by shopping online. Free Shipping Day, the brainchild of a coupon site, comes next. And Super Saturday, a retail industry term, rounds out the season on the last weekend before Christmas.As the calendar has become more crowded, retailers have resorted to increasingly far-fetched ideas to stand out. Infomercials tried to muscle into the game with a short-lived Info-Mania Sunday in 2007. That was the same year Wal-Mart called for Friday to be stretched over two days - a 48-hour Black Friday to accommodate its deals.

That is the notion that we can best face inflation by protecting everybody via an escalator clause. Indexing is neither a new idea (it was tried in Massachusetts in the 18th Century) nor a good one. The sooner we can dispose of it, the more quickly we can get on to the really serious business of fighting inflation.At first blush, indexing has a plausible ring to it. Because inflation unfairly hits some parts of society harder than others, it would seem equitable to even out the effects via an automatic escalator for everybody and everything. But indexing by itself does nothing to reduce inflation. Worse yet, if this gimmick seems to protect us all against price increases, it will also erode the public and political support necessary to keep inflation from escalating.But only at our peril can we forget that anti-inflationary measures are painful, unpleasant and unpopular.

The Pentagon has expressed concern that a go-it-alone Japanese effort would be a wasteful duplication of allied resources, while Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has insisted that Japan's security should be treated separately from its troublesome trade problems.Now, ""there will be some kind of cooperation, but we still don't know how,"" said Motoo Shiina, a parliament member involved in defense affairs.

That's why the New York Federal Reserve recently had to bail out the bailout, lending another $37.8 billion at more attractive terms.But the first transaction is still crushing the company, forcing a virtual liquidation. According to a source familiar with the company, AIG is suffering declines in renewals among corporate customers as it loses business to competitors. An AIG spokesman says, ""Renewals worldwide are strong, but there are variations depending on the region and line of business."" No one disputes, however, that interim CEO Ed Liddy's job is not so much to run the business as to prepare various AIG subsidiaries for quick and dirty sale, though there's no guarantee that the prices he gets will protect taxpayers from losses.We have little sympathy for a company that sought government assistance, except that in this case shareholders were never permitted to vote on the deal. The shareholder with the largest stake, former CEO Hank Greenberg, says the firm would have been better off in Chapter 11. AIG directors instead had every incentive to choose a transaction with the government -- even on horrible terms -- over bankruptcy. That's because a bankruptcy filing would have stripped directors of legal protection.",0,1.0,0.0,4844

731,"Japan Surplus On Trade Rose In December. TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus grew a greater-than-expected 14% in December, including a 23% expansion in the surplus with the U.S. that could worsen trade tensions between the two countries.Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose to 1.415 trillion yen ($12.36 billion) on a customs-cleared basis in December from 1.237 trillion yen a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. The December figures reversed a narrowing of 16% in the trade surplus in November, and set the country's surplus growing again for the 20th time in the past 21 months.For all of 1998, Japan's trade surplus expanded 40% to 13.985 trillion yen, while the surplus with the U.S. grew 33% to 6.697 trillion yen, the ministry said. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia shrank 36% last year to 3.977 trillion yen.In December, Japan's overall exports fell 12% to 4.130 trillion yen. But in a continuation of a pattern that has pushed Japan's surplus steadily higher since Asia's economic crisis hit, imports fell even faster, declining 22% to 2.715 trillion yen. On the import side, it was the steepest monthly drop in 12 years. Exports to the U.S. fell 6.1% to 1.175 trillion yen, while imports from the U.S. fell 25% to 578 billion yen, bringing Japan's surplus for the month to 597.26 billion yen.Japan's surplus could expand further if the country's weak economy continues to overwhelm the boost a strengthening yen usually gives to imports. A stronger yen tends to make imports more appealing because they cost less in yen terms. Still, in December, the drop in imports came despite an increase in the yen's value to an average of 119.91 per dollar in December from 128.18 yen per dollar the previous December.",0,1.0,0.0,4636

GWINNETT COUNTY, Ga. -- This was once the land of great expectations.A white-collar haven and one of the fastest-growing suburbs in the country, Gwinnett County, on Atlanta's northern rim, seemed like just the ticket for ambitious couples like Steve and Jean Alhadeff. When the Alhadeffs bought their $70,000 starter home in the brand-new Oakbrook Station subdivision in 1984, it was as much an investment as a place to live. The nearby hum of route I-85 didn't bother them much; it was only a matter of time before Mr. Alhadeff's accounting job would lead to a top finance position and they'd buy a bigger house in a better neighborhood. Ms. Alhadeff didn't bother to read the local paper. After all, they'd be moving on soon.But now, two corporate cutbacks and a real-estate slump later, the Alhadeffs are stuck. They're in the same house, which is worth roughly the same amount. Mr. Alhadeff, 37, is earning the same income, selling insurance.

One of the oddities of investing is that as the price of a stock goes down, the yield on the stock gets better.For example, if Zilch Power & Light Co. pays a $1 a year dividend, and the stock sells for $25, you are getting a yield of 4 percent. But let the stock sink to $12.50 a share and you are getting an 8 percent yield.Now, an 8 percent yield looks pretty good these days and, indeed, so does any stock that is selling for half the price of only 11 months ago. Thus, a lot of investors must be looking at the recent carnage in utility stocks and utility funds and wondering if it is time to go bargain hunting.Unfortunately, there's no easy answer. Electric utility stocks, once safe, dependable and boring, have become hotbeds of turmoil and uncertainty. Their sensitivity to changes in interest rates is only part of the story.Vast changes are taking place in the electricity business and the utilities, which once enjoyed a monopoly status, apparently will be forced to compete for business in a free-wheeling competitive environment that could hurt the value of their generating plants, their companies and their stock prices.",0,1.0,0.0,298

(Published 5/13/92)Enormous social and economic changes swept over the city of Los Angeles during the 1980s, including rising poverty and unemployment and a wave of immigration that transformed the city's racial profile, according to census figures released today.The detailed statistics, issued early by the Census Bureau to help guide the city in rebuilding from the recent riots, underscore the metamorphosis that many say helped set the stage for the violent upheaval.At the heart of that change is an increasingly multi-ethnic population, fueled by the arrival of more than 750,000 immigrants since 1980. When the census was taken in 1990, nearly 40 percent of city residents were foreign-born, an increase of two-thirds in just a decade.Hispanics and Asians together now make up half of the city's population, while both the white and the black share fell.

740,"Transparency and the Fed. Transparency is a hallmark of modern capitalism, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has made transparency a hallmark of his new regime. Yet among our leading financial institutions, opacity, not financial transparency, has been on the rise.The combination -- increasingly opaque financial markets and increasingly transparent monetary policy -- has created a dangerous brew of financial excesses. Unless both trends are reversed, financial stability will remain elusive.The explanation for increasingly opaque financial markets lies chiefly in securitization -- the conversion of non-marketable assets into marketable obligations -- which has accelerated dramatically in recent decades.In theory, securitized markets are supposed to operate on the basis of accurate and readily available prices, the clear assessment of credit quality, and objective analyses of these obligations by rating agencies and those engaged in trading and underwriting them. These virtuous mechanisms presumably have been reinforced by a host of new credit instruments, especially financial derivatives that mitigate risk taking. Securitization also has been supported by a dazzling array of new quantitative analytical techniques that are capable, according to practitioners, of defining risk probability down to decimal point levels.So what went wrong?

741,"A tax Scheme to Deindustrialize America. The Treasury Department's tax-reform proposal is a retreat from the supply-side principles put in place by President Reagan during his first term. Enactment of the proposal would reduce the profitability of investment and reinstate the declining productivity growth and the stagnation in the standard of living that characterized the economy during the 1970s -- with little or no offsetting gain in simplicity or fairness.During the 1970s, the capital-labor ratio and U.S. labor productivity growth collapsed under the impact of Keynesian demand management, bad tax law and increased labor-force growth. As a result, high-wage U.S. labor became increasingly uncompetitive in markets at home and abroad, and protectionist pressures rose. Despite its pro-free-trade stance, the Reagan administration has been unable to resist these pressures and has established quotas on Japanese cars and foreign steel products.The threat to free trade posed by the decline in U.S. labor productivity growth has serious implications for the future of the Western alliance. This alliance depends on European and Japanese access to U.S. markets. The alliance was easy to maintain during the 1948-68 period when the growth in the U.S. capital-labor ratio was more than three times higher, and productivity growth more than five times higher, than during 1973-80. Our allies' continued access to our markets is seriously threatened by the long-term deterioration in U.S. labor productivity. Only a sustained rise in productivity can prevent the unraveling of free trade and the Western alliance.Supply-side economics rose in response to these fundamental economic and strategic challenges. When I went to work for Rep. Jack Kemp in 1975, we understood exactly what was at stake. Despite the enormous stakes, it took years to move policy in the direction of the problem. An important step was finally taken in 1981 with the Reagan administration's Economic Recovery Tax Act, which reduced the cost of capital and increased the after-tax rate of return on U.S. investment. This fundamental change was possible only because the Reagan administration brought its tax policy to office with it (along with policy officials to enforce it) and did not permit the bureaucracy in the Treasury's Office of Tax Policy to determine policy or to design the 1981 legislation. If the permanent government had controlled the policy, it would have substituted its own agenda and never permitted the drop in the cost of capital that constituted the fundamental achievement of the 1981 bill.But bureaucracies recover quickly from defeats. As soon as the Reagan administration was knocked off balance by the Federal Reserve's recession and lost its policy vision in the general hysteria over the budget deficit, the permanent government seized the opportunity to reassert control. President Reagan was promised that the 1982 tax increase (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) would reduce the five-year deficit projections by one-third. Instead, the deficits doubled. But more important, and less remarked, TEFRA repealed a substantial part of the reduction in the cost of capital equipment enacted in 1981.",0,1.0,0.0,3736

WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association is mounting a major assault on some abuses in adjustable-rate mortgages, which have fueled the recent housing recovery.With such mortgages, dubbed ARMs, monthly payments change periodically along with prevailing interest rates. Their lower initial rates have made homes available to millions of families in recent months. Roughly two million home buyers have taken out more than $120 billion in ARMs since 1981. Industry figures show that they accounted for more than 75% of the $13 billion in new home loans made in February.Fannie Mae is worried because certain ARMs, largely marketed in Texas, California and the Southeast, provide first-year interest rates far below those of fixed-rate mortgages but with little or no limit on increases in future mortgage payments. With such arrangements, ""consumers could be turned off on an instrument that's essential, and secondly, the issue could become politicized,"" warned David Maxwell, chairman of the government-sponsored, privately owned association, in an interview. Yet ARMs ""are the key to the long-term solvency of our financial institutions,"" he added.The association's crackdown is taking three forms: A call to the lending industry to police the problem ARMs, restrictions on the type of ARMs Fannie Mae buys and inauguration of a consumer-education program.

Also true, itUas better for a President not to promise big things .that he canUat produce. Further true, thereUas a lot to be said for restraint in fiddling with the American economy in its present uncertain condition. Mr. Carter accepts all of those truths. ThatUas why his various proposals to hold down inflation are not going to change very much, very quickly. Meanwhile, the inflation rate seems to be rising.Consumer prices have risen 6 per cent over the past year. But during the winter they were rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent. Some of that acceleration was due to cold weather, but not all of it. Mr. Carter has set himself the target of reversing this trend and getting the rate down to 4 per cent by the end of 1979. How?HeUas right in excluding mandatory controls. Aside from any questions of policy, the legal authority to impose them has expired. If Mr. Carter tried to get a new law, the first reaction would be a wildfire of anticipatory price increases. All the people who were taken by surprise in 1971 by the Nixon controls are determined not to let it happen again. Politicians sometimes think of the economy as a great machine. But the machine has a memory.That memory would even make it perilous for Mr. Carter to try to set wage and price guideposts. The guidepostsUa maximum increase immediately becomes everybodyUas minimum increase. If a President has blessed a certain figure as permissible, who will settle for less? Then a competition begins to see who can bust the limit. President Johnson got two and a half yearsUa use out of his wage guidepost before it exploded in 1966.

For a president whose greatest passion seems to be winning the global economic competition, last week's news must have been awfully sweet.A flurry of economic indicators showed the U.S. economy surging, even as Europe and Japan remained mired in recession. U.S. unemployment fell sharply and consumer confidence shot up - all in a week that began with the free fall of the Tokyo stock market.Beyond these short-term numbers, some economists see a fundamental shift of America's position in the global economy. They argue that the United States has emerged from a period of economic ""restructuring"" - a polite term for brutal layoffs and cost-cutting - as the most vigorous and competitive economy in the world - and may be poised to retain that distinction for years to come.You could almost imagine President Clinton running to the White House balcony and shouting: ""We're Number One!""Certainly, there's a lot worth shouting about.

760,"In the Fray: White House Plan On Dividends Needs Renovation. Washington -- The much-feared Law of Unintended Consequences is alive and well in Washington, as evidenced by the fact that Congress is about to consider a White House economic plan that could compromise one of the nation's most effective community revitalization tools and put some of the most vulnerable members of our society at risk.Currently, the federal Historic Preservation Tax Credit (HPTC) offers a significant tax break for the rehabilitation of income-producing historic buildings. Another program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), provides a similar incentive for the creation of affordable housing. These two credits are often combined to leverage private-sector investment in projects that create affordable places to live.HPTC alone has sparked the renovation of more than 27,000 buildings and generated more than $18 billion of investment in the future of America's communities. Statistics show that in terms of job creation, increased household income and retail sales, $1 million spent on rehabilitation offers more benefits to a community than does the same amount invested in new construction -- and rehabilitation is exactly what the credit encourages. What's more, HPTC has spurred the creation or reclamation of almost 225,000 housing units, including more than 30,000 new units for low-and moderate-income residents.In terms of their impact, HPTC and LIHTC go far beyond the usual range of federal alphabet-soup laws. These credits help make historic rehab and low-income housing projects viable for profit-minded developers who might otherwise opt for less risky ventures. But they do something else as well -- something essential to the social and economic health of the nation: They put a roof over people's heads and bring new life to residential and commercial areas from coast to coast.Despite the fact that they have helped stabilize neighborhoods, create businesses and jobs, and boost tax revenues in small towns and big cities alike, these incentives are in danger of being marginalized by the current White House proposal. By allowing shareholders to receive tax-free dividends only on corporate profits that are fully taxed, the Bush plan could force companies to make a choice: Take the tax credit, or forgo it to offer tax-free dividends that will make shareholders happy. Many companies are likely to choose the latter option -- and even those that remain willing to invest in tax-credit projects are likely to invest less.",0,0.6396,0.3604000000000001,1703

Although I agree with most of his conclusions, I would like to make a few comments.Prof. Meltzer writes, ""Unexpected changes in output are a generally accepted measure of uncertainty and costly economic variability."" But often a ""change in output"" is simply the standard deviation of real GNP. Realistically, the rate of inflation, trade or current balance of payments, interest rates and effective exchange rate should be included in any economic indicator that measures uncertainty and variability.Second, in his interpretation of the actual function of floating exchange rates, Prof. Meltzer writes, ""Until the September 1985 agreement at the Plaza Hotel, evidence suggests that generally the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuated freely."" However, if the steady appreciation of the U.S. dollar under the so-called minimum intervention policy since early 1981 can be considered ""free,"" then the sharp appreciation of the yen since September 1985 has also been a ""free"" fluctuation.Third, I fully agree with his conclusion that ""fluctuating exchange rates only contribute to stability if policies are stabilizing."" In this respect, he leaves me with the impression that at the September 1985 meeting the authorities made realistic efforts to attain stability of exchange rates. I feel, however, that the importance of the agreement was neither that such an effort was made, nor that policies of various countries were coordinated, but that independent policies that each country deems best for its own benefit were coordinated.In this sense, the current efforts in Japan to increase domestic demand are not simply for the sake of the U.S., but in Japan's own interest.",0,1.0,0.0,3097

Much of the increase is attributable to medical inflation and to the growing proportion of older people whose smoking habits are catching up with them, said Thomas Novotny, coauthor of the study and an assistant dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. ""This is the rock-bottom estimate of the cost of smoking,"" he said.Researchers took the total U.S. expenditure on five ""smoking-related medical conditions"" - heart disease, emphysema, arteriosclerosis, stroke and cancer - and determined the amount of each attributable to smoking alone. They then calculated the costs of prescription drugs, hospitalization, physician care and home health care to treat those illnesses.The total does not include, Novotny said, the cost of treating burns caused by cigarette-related accidents or the special medical needs of some babies born to smoking mothers. The study comes at a politically important time as Congress considers hefty cigarette tax increases to pay for health care reform.

The deal, in which the two have essentially agreed to share regulatory oversight, paves the way to end an 18-year ban on single-stock futures.A futures contract is a promise to deliver or to buy at a set date in the future and at a set price a certain item--pounds of coffee, barrels of oil, or, in this case, stocks or bonds. By law, a futures contract must be traded on an exchange.Once the ban on single-stock futures is lifted, investors could, for example, sell a futures contract based on shares of International Business Machines Corp. to hedge against a decline in the price of the company's stock, or buy such a contract instead of buying the actual IBM shares.Single-stock futures could lower investors' risk by allowing them to hedge against price changes in stocks and bonds.

797,"The Treasury Market: Don't Fix What's Not Broken. A recent report by the Democratic Study Group recommends a new debt management policy by the Treasury Department to create interest savings on the financing of the debt and to spur economic growth. In spite of its good intentions, several of the basic concepts in the report are flawed and could be extremely unsettling to the financial markets if adopted.The heart of the report centers on the fact that there is an unusually large yield spread between the three-month Treasury bill and the 30-year Treasury bond, 424 basis points (2.95 percent vs. 7.19 percent as of Friday). Its conclusion is that if new Treasury financings that are being carried out in the longer-term issues were switched into the three-month T-bill sector, gargantuan interest savings would help pare the federal budget deficit. The interest paid on the debt was about $200 billion in fiscal 1992.The second part of the thesis holds that if the Treasury were to stop issuing 30-year bonds (it sold $44 billion worth last year), the lack of supply in that sector would cause long-term interest rates to decline. This in turn would lead businesses to invest more, and home building would accelerate as mortgage rates fell. A study by Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University is cited as evidence that in reducing the 30-year financings, long-term interest rates would fall by ""55 basis points.""One caveat: The Federal Reserve has to cooperate in keeping short- term interest rates low while the financing mix is being changed.Although the numbers are compelling, the rationale is much too simplistic and clinical, leaving out reality and market expectations. The Treasury market has performed well in recent weeks because President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen seem to be taking steps toward reducing the deficit. There also are indications that the Clinton administration's promised economic stimulus package may be moderate (around $20 billion) and that there is even a chance of further Fed easing of interest rates.

Many federal workers and retirees will pay more for health care next year if Congress adopts a Republican plan to base government premium contributions on a flat dollar amount pegged to overall inflation instead of a percentage of premiums based on faster-rising medical costs.The government share of premiums (about 75 percent) stays constant even when premiums go up. But the GOP plan would cap federal payments next year at about $1,500 for singles and $3,400 for families.Workers and retirees in low-cost plans could wind up paying little or nothing. But the GOP plan ties changes in the government cap to the regular consumer price index, which also may be adjusted downward. The government share now is based on a medical cost index that historically has increased much faster than the CPI.About 70 percent of enrollees would pay more unless they moved into less-costly plans that might shave benefits to hold down premiums.

For the Clinton years, their claim is accurate.The average annual growth rate of real GDP during Bill Clinton's presidency was 3.7%. The average annual growth rate of real GDP during the first seven years of George W. Bush's presidency was just 2.3%. When the growth rate for 2008 is announced, the average annual growth rate of real GDP for Mr. Bush's eight years in office will be less than 2%.Bill Clinton presided over a huge expansion in private-sector employment during his eight years in office: Payrolls increased by 21.14 million. Private-sector payrolls have increased by just 1.3 million under Mr. Bush. In other words, for every 16 private-sector payroll jobs created while Bill Clinton was in office, President Bush has overseen the creation of just one private-sector payroll job. To say the least, that is a significant difference, especially when one considers that Mr. Clinton raised tax rates and Mr. Bush reduced them.The robust economic and private-sector employment growth during the Clinton years was also reflected in the stock market.

A murder occurs in the U.S. headquarters of a major Japanese company, and the motive involves the transfer of a new high technology from U.S. to Japanese control. It could be a great movie, except for one possible production problem: The book's Japanese characters are such vile people that it's hard to imagine any self-respecting Japanese actor taking a role.""Japan bashing"" is rapidly becoming Japan loathing. Japan has been transformed into ""the enemy"" that threatens our economic future. All this is - quite literally - economic fiction. Japan's impact on our economy (though highly visible) remains modest. Our economic fate depends mostly on what we do for ourselves. Meanwhile, the growing venom against Japan is verging on hate-mongering. It distracts from our home-grown problems and legitimizes racism whose closest targets may be our country's 7.3 million Asian Americans.The loathing of Japan differs significantly from the loathing of the former Soviet Union. We despised communism but not the peoples subjected to it. They were its victims as well as its defenders. They could redeem themselves, as they have, by rejecting it. By contrast, the Japanese are increasingly vilified as a people. From this, there is no redemption.What's worrisome now is that these attitudes are being promoted by pop culture - a more powerful force than politics. Crichton's novel is a good example. With the exception of the main villain, most of the book's Japanese characters are not criminals. Yet, almost all of them are portrayed as creepy manipulators whose sinister influence is seeping into every aspect of American life. The Japanese are destroying our industries and infiltrating (usually via well-paid American lawyers and lobbyists) our political and cultural institutions.""{D}on't talk to me about hating, man,"" says Tom Graham, a tough detective in ""Rising Sun."" ""This country is in a war and some people understand it, and other people are siding with the enemy. Just like in World War II, some people were paid by Germany to promote Nazi propaganda.""

As immigration reform moves through Congress, one claim by opponents is that this time immigration is different because the country's latest arrivals aren't assimilating. On the contrary, however, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that today's immigrants are acculturating and moving up the economic ladder like previous generations.The media's tendency to report ""averages"" in educational attainment, English-language skills, income and other traditional measures of assimilation can make it difficult to determine whether immigrants are making gains. Since Latino immigration continues, averaging together the poverty rates or homeownership levels of large numbers of people who arrived recently with those who have been here for decades can provide a skewed view of progress.Measuring assimilation properly requires following the same immigrants over generations. And the good news is that longitudinal studies that take this approach show that Latino immigrants have made gains similar to other groups who preceded them.Consider the claim that Hispanic immigrants are rejecting English in favor of a separate Spanish-speaking culture. Census data from 2005 show that only one-third of immigrants in the country for less than a decade speak English well, but that number climbs to nearly three-quarters for those here for 30 years or more.A 2007 Pew study of 14,000 Latino adults showed that while just 23% of immigrants report being able to speak English very well, ""fully 88% of their U.S.-born adult children report that they speak English very well.

Revenue for materials used in making chips is expected to drop nearly 13% to $22.6 billion in 2002, following a 6% drop last year, the group said.",0,1.0,0.0,2670
827,"Stark end to polarizing tenure. On the day after Prince George's County Executive Jack B. Johnson was reelected in 2006 - the fourth time that residents had elected him to a countywide position - he wearily explained what accounted for his victory.Dogged for years by reports that state and federal authorities were investigating his relationships with developers and his hiring of friends for public office, Johnson will leave office next month a deeply polarizing figure.His detractors have long said his style of politics hurts the county's image and its efforts to spur business.For critics, that impression will be cemented by Johnson's arrest Friday, along with his wife, Leslie, just three weeks before his final term in office is to end. He was charged with destroying evidence and witness tampering.But for his supporters, he has remained a popular figure - an unfailing campaigner with an unparalleled ability to connect with voters.

830,"Fed Officials Tussle Over Labor Market Slack; Yellen Differs With Some Colleagues Over Effect on Inflation and Wages. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has argued consistently in recent months that labor markets are abundant with slack that will hold inflation and wages down. But she hasn't convinced all her colleagues.Minutes of the Fed's April 29-30 policy meeting showed a lengthy debate on this subject and suggested labor-market slack will become an important battleground in the central bank's coming discussions about how long to continue its low-interest-rate policies.Many economists believe lots of slack in the labor market--large numbers of unemployed or underutilized workers--means the Fed can keep interest rates very low to help boost economic growth without generating high inflation. Conversely, they think that if there isn't much slack, or that it decreases rapidly, the central bank should raise rates more quickly to keep price pressures under control.The unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in April, not far from its long-run average of 5.8%. Ms. Yellen has argued other measures--such as the nation's many part-time workers who want full-time work--represent slack holding wages down. While that view is broadly held at the Fed, the minutes showed she faced some pushback at the last meeting.""Some participants reported that labor markets were tight in their districts or that contacts indicated some sectors or occupations were experiencing shortages of workers,"" the minutes said about the Fed's discussions, without identifying the participants by name or specifying the number holding certain views.",0,0.6779999999999999,0.3220000000000001,4084

832,"Hamiltonian Democrats. It's come to this: The chief project to restate Democratic economics for our time was unveiled a couple of weeks ago, and it's named after the father of American conservatism, Alexander Hamilton.Necessarily, the authors of the Hamilton Project preface their declaration with an attempt, not altogether successful, to reclaim Hamilton from the right. The nation's first secretary of the Treasury, they note, ""stood for sound fiscal policy, believed that broad-based opportunity for advancement would drive American economic growth, and recognized that 'prudent aids and encouragements on the part of government' are necessary to enhance and guide market forces.""Which is true, as far as it goes. Hamilton believed in balanced budgets and in the government's taking an active role to build the infrastructure and fiscal climate that business and the nation need to succeed -- ideas as alien to the current administration as support for collective farms. But Hamilton also feared the common people, dismissed their capacity for self-government and supported rule by elites instead.That might be enough to deter most Democrats from naming their firstborn economic revitalization scheme after him, but the authors of the Hamilton Project are made of sterner stuff. They include Peter Orszag, an estimable Brookings Institution economist; investment banker Roger Altman, formerly of the Clinton Treasury department; and, chiefly, former Treasury secretary and current Citigroup executive committee Chairman Robert Rubin, whose iconic status within the Democratic mainstream has waxed as the median incomes of Americans under the Bush presidency have waned. Rubin has also become a seal of good housekeeping for Democratic candidates seeking money from Wall Street. When Bob Rubin talks, Democratic pols don't just listen; they scramble for front-row seats and make a show of taking notes.Much of what Rubin and his co-authors have to say in their statement is on the money. Since the mid-'70s, they note, ""prosperity has neither trickled down nor rippled outward."" They acknowledge that recapturing broadly shared prosperity in an age of globalization is a daunting conundrum. Still, they have some recommendations: Balance the budget (a principle they elevate to a fetish). Have the government invest more in ""education, health care, energy independence, scientific research, and infrastructure,"" since market forces ""will not generate adequate investments"" in such social essentials. Provide compensatory wage insurance for the many workers forced to take lower-paying jobs as middle-income jobs grow scarcer.",0,1.0,0.0,3560

834,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial) Cutting the Budget -- X: Cut to What Purpose?. {An Editorial Series}Far from being an impregnable fortress of ""uncontrollables,"" the federal budget is a mountain of fat. As this series has detailed, program after program could be cut to the long-term benefit of even their intended beneficiaries. If the Grace Commission recommendations were enacted tomorrow, government services would be delivered more efficiently across the board. If Pentagon cuts pared bloated staffs, we would have a leaner and meaner military. Cutting subsidies would give us a stronger farm sector, better transportation and so on. While we hesitate to mention it when middle-class welfare has scarcely been dented, in many ways the poverty programs have proved a burden on the poor.The only ""uncontrollable"" has been Congress, locked in a mirage of ""political reality"" and structured into petty fiefdoms guaranteeing indiscipline and inertia. On this front, the 1985 session offers at least a glimmer of hope. Buoyed by the resounding defeat of the last New Deal Democrat, the Republican administration will present a budget that at least offers a menu of budget reductions. In Robert Dole, the Republican Senate has a new activist leader who will go beyond the consensus of his colleagues and try to make his own mark -- a positive development even if we disagree with some of his ideas. On the budget, political will is starting to bud.We fear, though, that these tender buds will be nipped in a fit of ignorance and misunderstanding. While there is now an inchoate recognition that the budget needs to be cut, there is no cogent rationale of why. This will both lead to a splintering of the potential political coalition, and focus attention on the least meaningful kind of savings. The problem is that no one actually talks about cutting expenditures. Instead, everyone talks only of cutting the deficit.This rhetoric is bound to raise the suspicions of the supply-siders, ourselves included, for it has historically been a code word for raising taxes. As Alan Reynolds records nearby, this is a proven prescription for stagnation of both the economy and the government. (See: ""Less Will Get You More"" -- WSJ Jan. 23, 1985) It has been fashionable lately to calculate how much economic growth would be needed to eliminate the deficit with no increase in taxes. No one bothers to calculate what it would take to eliminate the deficit by raising taxes with no economic growth, though this clearly would be even more ""unrealistic""; nothing produces deficits like recession. In any anti-deficit strategy growth remains the key, and growth is not promoted by higher taxes.",0,1.0,0.0,2209

At the same time, the move would give the Chicago-based parent company of First National Bank of Chicago a banking charter in a state that has been hospitable to credit card issuers.Some Illinois state politicians have sought to force First Chicago and other charge card issuers to lower their interest rates -- First Chicago charges 19.8% on Visa and MasterCard balances -- as consumer deposit rates have fallen to about 5.5%.

844,"Home Loans Find New Hands --- Mortgage Servicing Shifts to Nonbank Firms, Fueling Concern Among Regulators. Washington's effort to push banks out of the mortgage-servicing business is propelling the handling of customers' loans into companies such as hedge funds and nonbank financial firms.The shift is fueling concern among federal and state regulators about the level of oversight and capital requirements in the industries now servicing a growing share of these loans.Banks such as Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ally Financial Inc., have been selling mortgage-servicing rights to nonbank companies, including Ocwen Financial Corp., and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., which have doubled their servicing portfolios in the past year.About $1.03 trillion of mortgage-servicing rights were sold in 2013, with the vast majority going to nonbank firms, said Guy Cecala, publisher and chief executive officer of industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.

But some experts have released their own projections.James Young, the Crowe Horwath professor of accountancy at Northern Illinois University, and specialists at tax publisher CCH, a unit of Wolters Kluwer, say the official inflation rate used to adjust the numbers will be about 1.6%, lower than last year's 2.5% rate and 2011's 3.8% rate. Their estimates are based on data released by the U.S. Department of Labor.Most taxpayers will experience modest savings from inflation indexing, says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at CCH. A married couple filing jointly who have $100,000 of taxable income, for example, will owe about $145 less for 2014 compared with 2013 because of tax-bracket indexing, and they also will realize small gains from changes to the personal exemption and the standard deduction.Congress added the adjustments to the tax code starting in the late 1980s in an effort to prevent taxpayers from owing more simply because inflation pushed them into higher brackets and eroded benefits.

""As said before, all these steps can't be discussed furtherthey need urgently to be implemented.""Mr. Milberg said investment and workflexibility programs under way at Rover ""are just the start of a row of measures,"" adding that BMW will ""do everything"" to deliver the Rover 75 model ""at a BMW-quality level.""Speculation surfaced last week that details of additional restructuring at Rover, of Britain, would come at the group's annual shareholders' meeting May 18. BMW's supervisory board is set to meet March 18.Less than two weeks ago, Mr. Milberg succeeded as chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder, who stepped down from the post amid sharp criticism of problems and financial losses at Rover.

Financial independence, that is.Here's the deal. The United States has the mightiest economy in the world, but we've become enormously dependent on foreign investors to lend us the money it takes to keep Uncle Sam's checks from bouncing. At least, that's how I interpret Treasury statistics that track the size and ownership of our national debt.The statistics show that foreign and international investors account for the entire increase in privately owned Treasury securities since George W. Bush took office. Issuing those securities is how the Treasury covered federal budget shortfalls. Privately owned Treasury securities are those that belong to investors, as opposed to those owned by federal government trust funds or the Federal Reserve Board. Private investors own about half our $7 trillion-plus of national debt; the Fed and federal trust funds own the rest.According to Treasury data -- table OFS-2, if you want see for yourself, on the Web at url b24ofs.doc -- when the Bush administration started, we had $2.88 trillion of privately held national debt, of which $1.03 trillion was owned by foreign and international investors. As of March 31, the most recent data available, privately owned debt had risen to $3.5 trillion, of which foreigners owned $1.71 trillion.Now, a little math. Privately owned debt, as you can see, was up by $620 billion since the Bush administration started -- but foreigners' holdings were up by $680 billion. This means that foreigners accounted for the entire increase in privately held debt - - and then some.",0,1.0,0.0,3189

Hassett and Aparna Mathur's(op-ed, Oct. 25), analyses showing growing inequality in the U.S. err by focusing largely ""on pretax incomes while ignoring the transfer payments and spending from unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid and other safety-net programs."" The authors tell us that in measuring inequality, we should look to consumption rather than pretax cash income. This, allegedly, is because consumption ""will be set by consumers with an eye on their lifetime incomes.""Oh, really? How about single parents, pensioners or enlisted military personnel who resort to payday loans? Their consumption is set with an eye on their immediate, pressing needs, not their lifetime incomes.The authors seem to think that inequality can be measured by the quantity of washing machines or microwaves in poor homes. They don't consider debt levels. They seem unacquainted with foreclosures. They show no interest in future prospects.Most remarkable of all, the authors would undo the very basis of the equality, such as it is, that they perceive in America. The safety net?

855,"A Working Thesis: Growth of Labor Force Slows, Raising Hopes Of Lower Jobless Rates --- Trend, if It Holds, May Lead To Greater Productivity; How Women Affect Data --- Baby Boomers Come of Age. The rapid decline in the unemployment rate to 8.4% in November from a postwar high of 10.8% just 11 months earlier has surprised economists and pleased the Reagan administration. But the best news may lie in the future.Analysts see in the recent jobless data signs of a significant change in the growth of the work force. ""We're switching from a decade in which the labor force grew faster than the population to one in which it will grow slower,"" William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Purdue University, says.If this trend holds, the current decade could turn out to be the mirror image of the economically troubled 1970s. The work force exploded in the last decade as women and members of the ""baby boom"" generation sought jobs. ""We had some digestive problems,"" says Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, noting that in the 1970s the jobless rate rose, the rate of growth of worker productivity slowed and inflation soared. But in this decade, ""we may find ourselves able to do more on the employment front without causing an increase in inflation,"" Mr. Bosworth says.Sidney Jones, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, adds, ""After getting ourselves convinced that 6 1/2% is a natural rate of unemployment, it may be that we can do better than that.""An easing of labor-force growth could have other implications as well. For instance, older workers, who in recent years were pushed out of the labor market by early-retirement plans to make room for younger workers, may find themselves in more demand again. Mr. Dunkelberg believes that the retirement age is likely to rise during the current decade as employers, faced with shortages of new workers, rely on older workers to stay on the job longer.",0,0.6964,0.3036,2431

DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. posted a 2.6% decline in March sales from its strong year-earlier results, while Toyota Motor Corp. had its best March ever, with a 5% increase in U.S. light-vehicle sales.Overall, March vehicle sales, buoyed by robust results from Toyota, General Motors Corp. and a host of smaller auto makers, surged to their highest seasonal level since last August. Some economists are predicting the sales numbers may be a factor in prompting the Federal Reserve to consider another interest-rate increase.Sales of cars and light trucks in March totaled 1,388,790, 1.3% more than last March's strong sales and equivalent to a seasonally adjusted rate of more than 15.7 million vehicles a year, based on the Commerce Department's revised factors.

Some valid questions may indeed be raised about the design and efficiency of our aid program for Russia. Certainly, the rhetoric of ""shock therapy,"" ""irreversible change"" and ""strategic partnership,"" originally used to sell Russian reform to the American public was naively romantic. But Krauthammer's proposal to disengage U.S. assistance is misguided.Russia is not Cuba or North Korea. A starvation strategy of noncooperation cannot possibly work with Russia. It is too important strategically and has too many nuclear warheads. Active, constructive engagement with Russia is the only responsible option. It is also the best way to address Krauthammer's warning that Russia will follow China's nakedly authoritarian path.Engagement must be recognized for what it is. It is not a magic wand. Nor is it a marriage vow. Understood correctly, it should be a strategy of pragmatic cooperation based on expanding spheres of mutual interest.Foreign aid to the post-Communist countries, including Russia, has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It is a bag of tactical interventions and subventions -- know-how and cash -- to promote desirable political and economic developments. Admittedly, there is more art than science to foreign aid, but over the years we have also learned what does and does not work. For example, trying to ""buy"" elections usually backfires. Trying to impose textbook political and economic models on non-textbook conditions is unwise. Pushing radical reform while ignoring its social consequences (such as unemployment) also is a bad idea, especially if the unemployed get to vote.Krauthammer argues that it is simply not in our national interest to help the Russians with their economic travails. Yeltsin, the butcher of Chechnya, has turned out to be a bad guy, so why support him? On the other hand, should Yeltsin lose in next June's presidential election -- a distinct possibility -- it would be better for us if his likely neo-communist successor, Gennady Zyuganov, faced a crippled economy.",0,0.6675,0.3325,3306

But the acquisitions never coalesced into a viable operation. Work overlaps and internal rivalries, exacerbated by the securities-industry recession following the 1987 crash, socked Kemper with more than $200 million of losses in its securities unit during the past four years.Now the company approaches the end of a radical, 11-month reorganization of its Kemper Securities Group Inc. It is stripping down the regional firms -- Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles; Blunt Ellis & Loewi in Milwaukee; Prescott, Ball & Turben in Cleveland; Boettcher & Co. in Denver; and Lovett Underwood Neuhaus & Webb in Houston -- and moving many of their functions to Chicago. In the process, it has laid off about 1,100 employees at the five firms -- almost one in five.Kemper projects the reorganization will save $50 million this year for the securities division, which posted a loss of $193.5 million in 1990, including a $126.5 million charge to cover goodwill and other restructuring-related costs.At Kemper Securities, the reorganization's chief architect is James R. Boris, chairman and chief executive officer since January 1990. Mr. Boris declined to be interviewed because, a spokesman says, the reorganization isn't complete.

But educators say they are working to ensure that the cuts do not affect the quality of instruction.Annual state education aid has increased by well over $1 billion since 2002 as a result of the Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act, better known as the Thornton plan for the commission that recommended it.

Author: Wayne SwanIt's an unfortunate reality that two years from the start of the financial crisis, many of the world's advanced economies are still grappling with near double-digit unemployment rates, an anemic private recovery and high sovereign debt. Many countries are still yet to recoup the output lost during the crisis. But that's not the Australian story, and it's important to understand why, and what lessons can be learned from our experience.In 2009 the global economy contracted for the first time since the 1930s but the Australian economy continued to grow. We have an unemployment rate of 5.1%--around half the levels seen in the United States and Europe. Our net debt will peak at just 6% of GDP in 2011-12. By comparison, the collective government net debt of major advanced economies is expected to hit 90% of their GDP in 2015. And we're on track to get the budget back to surplus in 2012-13--years ahead of every major advanced economy.So how have we come through the crisis in such good shape? Our banking system is one of our great strengths. Only nine of the hundred largest banking groups in the world are rated AA or above--and four of those are Australian. Even at the height of the crisis, no Australian bank, building society or credit union required an injection of government funds. We also have tough and effective regulators. And we didn't suffer the financial market excesses of Europe and the U.S.But it wasn't only the strength of our banks; prudent monetary and fiscal policy played a role, too. When the crisis began, the Reserve Bank of Australia aggressively cut interest rates to emergency levels and the government immediately put in place powerful fiscal stimulus to support jobs and growth. Our response was quick enough and big enough not just to arrest the decline in confidence, production and spending, but to turn them around.",0,1.0,0.0,3167

Net interest revenue fell by a third to $724 million but rose slightly from the previous quarter.In the third quarter, the bank, formed in July 2007 when Bank of New York acquired Mellon Financial Corp., sold or restructured billions of dollars in risky investments, a move that hurt its bottom line at the time but set it up for fewer one-time charges or losses. It struggled last year with investment write-downs and securities losses because of troubles at secondary businesses, such as those related to real estate, and ongoing weakness in fee revenue.Bank of New York Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the continuation of low interest rates continued to weigh on net interest and fee revenue. But he noted the company saw ""excellent growth"" in asset and wealth management revenue during the quarter.",0,1.0,0.0,2640
874,"Politics & Economics: Credit-Card Issuers on the Spot; Democrats to Scrutinize Impact of Fine Print on Middle Class. Washington -- Democrats in congress are bringing the credit-card industry in for fresh scrutiny, renewing a push to protect consumers from lurking fees, interest-rate spikes and other hazards of the fine print.Today, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd is to hold a hearing on disclosure, marketing and billing strategies of credit-card firms, the first in a series of hearings on how the industry affects consumers. Meanwhile, a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee headed by Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, has launched a probe into misleading credit-card practices.In a study requested by Mr. Levin, the Government Accountability Office recently noted a jump in the number of consumers facing interest rates over 25%, big increases in average fees charged for late payments or exceeding a limit and inconsistencies in how credit- card companies disclose fees to consumers.The flurry of activity marks a shift for the credit-card industry, which generally enjoyed favorable treatment on Capitol Hill under Republican rule. As recently as two years ago, Congress was more focused on the effect delinquent borrowers had on lenders, and it passed a landmark law making it harder for borrowers to erase debts by filing for bankruptcy. Banks cheered, and consumer advocates fumed.With Democrats now in control of the agenda, the microscope is being focused on how terms offered by banks and credit-card networks burden many consumers. At the least, congressional scrutiny likely will encourage some issuers to move away from practices Mr. Dodd says ""trap consumers in a hole of debt from which they may never recover.""",0,1.0,0.0,4978

877,"Gaining Capital. Some people continue to believe, or at least still assert, that tax rates don't influence taxpayer behavior all that much. We therefore direct their attention to the Treasury Department's latest historical data on revenues from taxes on capital gains.The numbers look like a 25-year demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action. As the nearby chart shows, taxes paid on capital gains have been highly responsive to the maximum capital gains tax rate. (See accompanying table -- WSJ Jan. 24, 2005) Especially notable is how, over the years, capital gains realizations and the taxes paid on those gains have tended to increase in the years following a cut in the capital gains tax rate.The reductions highlighted in the chart include the famous William Steiger tax rate cut that passed Congress in late 1978 over Jimmy Carter's objections, the Reagan tax cut passed in 1981, and the cut that was part of the Clinton-Gingrich balanced budget deal of 1997. All of those reductions caused taxpayers to cash in more of their gains and thus yielded revenue windfalls for the federal Treasury in succeeding years.On the other hand, the capital gains tax increase of 1986 -- which moved the rate back up to 28% from 20% -- proved to be a revenue disaster. Taxes paid on long-term capital gains (those typically held longer than one year) fell off a cliff to $33.7 billion in 1987 from $52.9 billion a year earlier. And they stayed at close to that mediocre lower level for nearly another decade. In other words, higher rates didn't do anyone any good, not even the politicians who thought they'd be getting more tax revenue to spend.We aren't asserting that tax-rate changes have been the only factors influencing revenue changes. The performance of the broader economy and the stock market have also mattered a great deal. Capital gains revenues boomed in the late 1990s after the 1997 rate cut, but they fell abruptly with the bursting of the dot-com and tech bubbles in 2001.",0,1.0,0.0,2276

Amid a climate of optimism, bond investors expect economic data this week to do little to determine the Federal Reserve's next step for monetary policy.That should make for a week of calm trading, in contrast to last week, which proved an important period for bond-market participants. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spent Wednesday and Thursday testifying before Congress about the central bank's outlook for the economy and monetary policy. He told legislators he expects growth to moderate, and while he is concerned by the recent flare-up in price pressures, he expects the reduced momentum to keep inflation in line. The chairman also stuck to a familiar refrain regarding monetary policy: where interest rates go next is a function of how the economy performs, he said.Bond traders responded to Mr. Bernanke's comments by pushing prices higher.

886,"China's stiff upper hand. The idea of ""rebalancing"" the world economy is simple. Before the financial crisis, some advanced countries (led by the United States) were overspending, and some poorer countries (led by China) were oversaving. The two offset each other. The big spenders ran large trade deficits, and the big savers ran large trade surpluses. Now, the financial crisis has dampened the overspending. If the big savers don't increase their spending, the world economy faces prolonged slow growth. Countries may battle each other for shares of that weak demand by managing exchange rates, subsidies or tariffs.This is a formula for economic strife, whether called ""currency wars,"" protectionism or economic nationalism. As wealthy countries wrestle with stubborn unemployment (9.6 percent in the United States, 10.1 percent in France, 20.5 percent in Spain), it will become harder to resist policies that favor local businesses and workers, especially if other countries are doing the same. Avoiding this future is the central issue facing leaders of the Group of 20 economies when they meet this week in Seoul.The world's second-largest economy has run blatantly mercantilist (that is, discriminatory) economic policies for years. The resulting huge trade surpluses boosted job growth and, while much of the world boomed, they were tolerated. In 2007, China's current account surplus (mainly trade) reached 11 percent of its economy (gross domestic product). But as China has moved up the value chain - from toys to telecommunications equipment - and as the world economy weakened, its surpluses have become more threatening to more countries.Like Japan before it, China embraced an investment-led and export-led economic model, explains economist Eswar Prasad of Cornell University. Manufacturers receive subsidized land and energy; the exchange rate of the renminbi is controlled and kept depressed, making Chinese exports more competitive on world markets and making imports into China more expensive. Bank lending rates, regulated by government, are also kept low so that companies can borrow cheaply.The result has been rapid, though lopsided, industrialization. Economic growth has averaged about 10 percent annually for several decades. In modernizing, China shut down or streamlined many inefficient state-owned enterprises; the job loss was substantial, 43 million from 1997 to 2004, says the World Bank.

The Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, but it was hardly out of complacency.Caught between heightened inflation fears and persistent concerns about a sluggish economy, Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers decided to leave the Fed's key short-term interest rate unchanged at 2%. The non-move marked the end of a series of rate cuts dating back to last summer, when credit woes were creeping up on the economy. The latest vote was 9-1, with Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, once again dissenting, this time opting for a rate increase. And, indeed, recent comments from Fed personages -- including Wednesday's commentary -- suggest the bank's next rate move will be upward. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased,"" the Fed said in its statement. The bank is in a bit of a pickle. Reporter Sudeep Reddy writes that Fed officials are trying to avoid rate increases for now to avoid exacerbating the weakness in employment, financial markets and the housing sector. At the same time, they are trying to signal they're serious about fighting inflation by talking about the risks of rising inflation expectations and suggesting a willingness to act quickly if inflation expectations get out of hand.

The Chinese then disappeared from the Pakistani nuclear plant, and the Chinese government repeatedly declared that it does not help other countries to make weapons.That now presents the United States with a choice. One side of the argument is that China has never offered the kind of detailed and carefully defined assurances that meet American legal standards. The other side is that itUas well worth securing even the Chinese style of pledge from a country that already possesses both nuclear weapons and a goodCongress can block the agreement by a joint resolution.

A number of senators, most of them Democrats, are going to press for assurances that the agreement meets the letter of the American nuclear export laws that were enacted to prevent the proliferation of weapons. There are also objections, originating in the Defense Department, that even civilian nuclear technology has, in the Chinese context, military applications. They have less to do with weapons dfrectly than with the development of nuclear power plants for naval ships, particularly submarines.The administration bears the burden of demonstrating that this agreement, inadequate a year ago, is satisfactory today. That is not an impossible case to make, but the administration is going to have to make it openly and forcefully. A lot depends on the precise language of a text that no one outside the administration has yet seen. But at least potentially there may be important benefits here for controlling the spread of nuclear weapons. Until recently China chose to remain entirely outside the structure of international promises that seek to prevent proliferation. An agreement with the United States, providing access to certain American technology, would provide a powerful incentive to come in and stay in.",0,0.6738,0.32620000000000005,1669

The excuse, at least for the TV cameras, was that America can't pay for a war and cut taxes at the same time.We've heard some whoppers out of Washington, but this one deserves its place in history.

It's ""not the American way,"" he actually said, forgetting that America's first war more or less started over the issue of taxes. He also forgot the Cold War, which was finally won in the 1980s with a combination of Ronald Reagan's tax cut to spur the economy and defense buildup to show the Soviets they couldn't win.It also ignores the experience of the 1960s, when JFK cut taxes and spurred a boom that helped finance war in Vietnam as well as the Great Society, at least until LBJ decided he had to ""pay for"" the war by passing his growth-inhibiting ""surtax."" This week White House spokesman Ari Fleischer cited JFK on this point, from 1962 at the height of the Cold War, and the words are worth reprinting:""We shall, therefore, neither postpone our tax cut plans, nor cut into essential national security programs.

899,"Dismal Science: Mortgages and Musical Chairs. Financial crises usually come from left field. But that doesn't stop swamis from searching for the next trigger. Right now, the prospect of rising interest rates is focusing swamis on trouble in the bond market. Not a bad bet, since the past few years of falling rates have produced a ton of complicated ways to extract profits from fixed- income securities. Also not a bad bet since a forecast of higher rates is driving investors to unwind positions -- presenting a perfect moment to expose flaws in hedging and other strategies.So it's hardly surprising that concentration of risk is Topic One. Consider, for example, a recent speech by the new head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In lovely Fed-speak, Timothy Geithner blended concerns about the increasing vulnerability of the financial system to the growth in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the high degree of concentration in the market for interest-rate options.Mr. Geithner was vague in the extreme, but the details of his concern are laid out in a report from Credit Suisse First Boston. Here are the mechanics of a possible crisis scenario in which the particular nature of risk in the mortgage market becomes concentrated in the market for interest-rate options.The chain of transmission starts with the mortgage market. (Bear in mind that, at some $7 trillion, this market is enormous.) Mortgages are of course wondrous financial instruments. They allow people, even those with humble means, to own a big asset -- a house -- without having to pay the full price up-front. But mortgages have an almost as wondrous property -- they give home buyers the opportunity to pay off before maturity. This prepayment option allows homeowners to transfer interest-rate risk to mortgage holders.Holders of mortgage securities borrow money to buy those securities. If all goes according to plan, holders buy securities that yield more than they pay on their debt. However, when interest rates fall and homeowners prepay, mortgage holders find that cash flows have changed. What was a nice deal of, say, receiving 6% on mortgages and paying 5% on debt could become a less comfortable arrangement of receiving 5% on mortgages and paying 5% on debt. Not good. Or say that interest rates go up; then homeowners keep their mortgages and holders could find themselves getting 6% on assets but paying 6% on debt. Also not good.",0,1.0,0.0,1785

House Republicans complained the move created uncertainty, but were forced to give in on the extension after Democrats depicted them as blocking a tax cut.The House returns Tuesday and the Senate next week, and lawmakers will immediately plunge back into the fight over the payroll tax.Congress faces a Feb. 29 deadline to extend the popular tax break, which reduces workers' payroll taxes to 4.2% from 6.2%, as well as a program to prolong unemployment benefits.

WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier.

During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January.

In reviewing the U.S. Treasury bond market in 1991, one cannot help but be impressed by the steep decline in interest rates and by the volume of actual financing.We are all aware of the weakness that permeated the economy and how the Federal Reserve responded to that weakness during the year. Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term UIadministeredU ratesUOthe discount rate and the federal funds rateUOwhich the Fed directly controls.As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.Another feature of last yearUas market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates.

But because overall volume also soared on the exchange, the percentage figure of 11.3% wasn't a record; indeed, it represented a decline from last year's 11.6%. (The record was 11.9% in 1993.)The Big Board has released program-trading data since mid-1988, in response to an outcry over the multistock trading activity and its role in the 1987 stock-market crash. Program trading is defined as the buying or selling of a group of at least 15 different stocks valued at a total of $1 million or more.The five most active program-trading firms in 1995 through the end of September, the latest numbers available, were Morgan Stanley Group Inc.; First Options; the U.S. unit of Japan's Nomura Securities; CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holding; and Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit.The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and options. In 1995, such trading accounted for 30.3% of overall program trading, down from nearly 39% in 1994.",1,0.3772,0.6228,67

Some optimistic experts are now saying that though this will be a turbulent year for global markets, the worst of the financial crisis is now behind us. Would it were so. We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global ""stag-deflation"": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years. During the 1980s, the U.S. also faced the burdens of twin deficits, but relied on financing from key strategic partners like Japan and Germany. This time, the situation is more worrisome because today's financing comes not from U.S. allies, but from strategic rivals like Russia, China and a number of relatively unstable petrostates.

Economic indicators released Friday confirmed what tight-fisted American consumers have already concluded: The economy may be recovering, but barely.Retail sales grew 0.4 percent in July after falling a revised 0.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported. The increase was the first one in three months and was mainly attributable to a rebound in auto sales boosted by dealer incentives. Department store sales declined 1 percent, and sales at clothing stores fell 0.7 percent. Despite the slight gain, sales failed to meet expectations.Business inventories, a key piece of data that economists use to judge the growth of the wider economy, rose for the sixth consecutive month in June to 0.3 percent. Sales at the wholesale level fell for the second month in a row, although the 0.6 percent decline was significantly less than the 1.2 percent drop in May.Consumer sentiment is similarly lukewarm. An index of what they think about the economy by Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan rose to 69.6 in early August from 67.8 in July, which had been the lowest level since November, Reuters reported. Despite the small increase, consumers did not anticipate an improved economy any time soon.Consumer inflation edged up for the first time in four months and slightly above forecasts to 0.3 percent in July, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to the Labor Department.

With the economy strong and the balanced-budget fight behind them, Democrats and Republicans find themselves groping for economic issues to argue about when they return to Washington this week.Part of the problem, strategists from both parties acknowledge, is that economic issues simply don't stir voter passions when times are so good: when inflation is subdued, the jobless rate has fallen to a three-decade low and the stock market remains buoyant. Indeed, many economic policy entrepreneurs say they are writing off the next two years and instead are concentrating on ideas that will resonate in the 2000 presidential campaign.Equally vexing, however, is that policy proposals being debated in both political camps seem as likely to highlight intra-party differences as to draw clear distinctions between Republicans and Democrats.White House economic advisers, reflecting President Clinton's interest in securing his legacy, are pondering long-term challenges -- how to boost productivity through improvements in education, for example, or how to ensure lasting solvency for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

WASHINGTON -- Orders for durable manufactured products dropped 0.9% in August, while a related indicator of business investment plummeted for the third consecutive month, the Commerce Department said.The orders report is a crude and highly volatile measure of business activity, but it does suggest the economy may be slowing more sharply than most economists have predicted.Orders for non-defense capital goods, an indicator of business plans to invest in new equipment, plunged 6.3% in August, following a 2.5% decline in July and a 3.2% drop in June. Many analysts had been counting on business investment to propel the economy in coming months, now that consumer spending seems to have slowed. But if orders for capital goods continue to decline and consumer spending stays weak, the economic expansion could fizzle out in the next few months.Nevertheless, economic forecasters continue to believe that the economy will perk up this fall.

But last week's crisis suggests that, just as few people in the country seems to know much history, science or culture, the mechanisms of modern capitalism are widely misunderstood and that this is a field much dependent on faith: You put money in the bank, and after that, all is currency transubstantiation.And why not?

948,"Reigning Wisdom's Shaky Economic Ground. Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the ""overvalued"" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)",1,0.0,1.0,250

WASHINGTON -- The administration and the Federal Reserve have cited a ""credit crunch"" as one of the main reasons the U.S. economy is in recession. The following questions and answers attempt to explain this troublesome phenomenon.What is the credit crunch?Simply put, it is the widespread reluctance of banks to lend to borrowers to whom they would have lent eagerly in the past. Because banks play a central role in financing economic growth, the credit crunch has broad effects on the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says it has ""very little historic precedent.""What caused it?With more and more loans going sour, the economy weakening and real estate values falling, bankers have grown more cautious. The memories of the excesses and financial failures of the 1980s are crimping lending in the 1990s. In addition, new rules, or capital standards, require many banks to either raise more capital from investors or make fewer loans. Unable or unwilling to raise capital, many banks are pulling back on lending.",1,0.0,1.0,281

Friedman's response: ""Then why not use spoons instead of shovels?""That story came to mind last week when President Obama linked technology to job losses. ""There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers,"" he said. ""You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM, you don't go to a bank teller, or you go to the airport and you're using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate.""The president calls this a structural issue--we usually call it progress. And it isn't exactly a new phenomenon. It's been going on for centuries, and its pace has accelerated over the past 50 years. Businesses relentlessly look for ways to replace workers with machines.

Government Spending Holds Key to GrowthAs goes government spending, so goes the U.S. economy.This is the unpleasant reality a weak recovery and already stretched Federal Reserve have bequeathed. Absent a sudden pick-up in private-sector activity, economic growth in the months ahead will largely take its cue from Congress and the White House. No wonder markets are jittery.For one, the hit from spending cuts across all levels of government has already been a major drag on growth. Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or ""outlays,"" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.

Retailers can sometimes keep their percentage markups constant when input costs rise.The cost of food for home consumption does indeed look set for a rebound. After falling 2.4% last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, retailers are beginning to predict that it will resume its upward march. This week, Wal-Mart Stores said it expects food deflation to abate this year and Winn-Dixie forecast outright inflation in the second quarter. Friday's consumer-price index data for January could add to the evidence.This year could be more complicated than usual. First, the initial round of food inflation is likely to occur in perishables such as milk, whose price has already rebounded in recent months. Just as some grocers saw perishables volumes rise last year when prices fell, the reverse could be true if prices rise.Second, packaged-food prices could keep falling for some time. Even if raw ingredient costs begin to rise, many manufacturers have locked in lower raw-material prices using hedges.

But it could backfire and fuel fears that the Fed, by using its power to print money to help the government finance soaring budget deficits, is kindling inflation. Those fears could, paradoxically, send Treasury yields higher.The market's initial reaction was mostly positive. Treasury yields dropped sharply, as previous research conducted by Mr. Bernanke suggested would happen. The Bank of England's decision earlier this month to begin purchasing government debt provided comfort that the move would work.

For a quarter-century, a Boston inventor has been obsessed with a single idea: an innovation that would give millions of American workers the chance to borrow their own money from their 401(k) savings plans using a new kind of credit card.In 1980 the inventor, an animated fellow named Francis Vitagliano, shared his concept with an MIT professor, Franco Modigliani. The Italian-born economist had been writing for 20 years about his theory of how and when people spend and save money during their lifetime, the so-called Life-Cycle Hypothesis. Modigliani's work would win him the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics, but the call from Vitagliano would, he thought, give him a way to test his theory in real life.The men became champions for this new financial instrument, spending untold sums for a patent on the card idea, trying to sell it to banks and credit card companies, and withstanding a barrage of criticism from members of Congress and the financial community.Franco Modigliani died last year at age 85. But tomorrow in Washington, Francis Vitagliano, now 55, is scheduled to watch as the 401(k) card is unveiled at a financial conference.

The Dow, which spent most of the day on the minus side, was off as much as 29 points at 2 p.m. but recovered somewhat by the close of trading.The bond market was the focal point of yesterday's action as the price of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell $17.50 for every $1,000 of face value, raising yields to almost 9.5 percent. The bond's price dropped $11.50 per $1,000 on Tuesday. Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions in order to adjust the yield of older bonds to make them competitive with newer bonds.Market analysts said the fall in bond prices was based on continued weakness of the dollar in global currency markets and signs of growing strength in the nation's economy. The bond market interprets both events as the forerunners of tighter money policies, higher interest rates and losses in the value of bonds.In the currency markets, the dollar fell below 141 yen and below 1.8 West German marks.

The economic story of his Presidency is by now familiar: a plodding recovery that has taken its third dip in three years and is barely raising incomes for most Americans.""We're still in a position where we are pulling ourselves out of the very deep hole caused by the Great Recession, and there is still -- of course -- a great deal of anxiety in the country about the economy,"""" said White House press secretary Jay Carney. He's right about the anxiety, but if only we were ""pulling ourselves out.""The reality is that the Great Recession ended three long years ago. In this Less Than Great Recovery, the economy shows promise for one good quarter then slows back down. As the nearby chart shows, this is the third straight year of sputtering recovery. Growth of 4.1% in the fourth quarter declined to 2% in the first and now 1.5% in the second. The stock market rose as investors bet that the lousy growth will inspire more Federal Reserve easing.The sliver of good news is that private growth, which is what really matters, was up a slightly less anemic 1.8%, and government spending fell by a minus-1.4% from the first quarter. Housing is also now less of a drag on GDP. But this makes the paltry 1.5% growth more disconcerting, because it means that other parts of the economy are growing less rapidly than they ought to be.Consumption ticked up only 1.5%, for example, down from 2.4% in the first quarter. This may reflect that wages and salaries are barely keeping pace with inflation. Another negative is that business inventories climbed unexpectedly in the second quarter, which often presages a decline in business spending in the next quarter to clear the shelves.",1,0.32230000000000003,0.6777,509

Consequently, interest rates have been only slightly below the recent highs UO which have been around the highest rates in over 20 years.The latest rate for new 91-day Treasury Bills was about 3.47 per cent, only slightly below the then prevailing discount rate of 3.5 per cent and well above the new discount rate of 3 per cent. Jn theory, the new condition would seem to encourage member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks at 3 per cent and use the funds to buy bills at 3.45 per cent, which would, of course, tend to expand bank credit.A reduction of the discount rate below the bill rate is a most unusual development, in fact, I cannot find a duplication of it in the record of the past 25 years.THE MOVE is all the more startling because public remarks made by FRB Chairman Martin only about two w'eeks ago were bluntly in defense of the tight credit policy, and his observations then would seem to justify the publicUas interpretation that the tight credit policy was likely to continue.",1,0.3468,0.6532,514

The deficit reflected a decline in exports of $1.5 billion, while imports remained largely flat. The drop covered a broad range of exports, but a number of analysts dismissed it as a statistical aberration.""Over the last year, exports were up 10%; over the last three months, exports rose almost 20% at an annual rate,"" says John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns.

The first employment report under the new system will be issued Feb. 4.If a higher unemployment rate is reported as a result of the agency's changes, it wouldn't mean the economy has suddenly gotten worse. It would indicate, however, that the department has been consistently underestimating the number of unemployed people. October's unemployment rate, the latest figure available, rose to 6.8% of the work force, putting the jobless total at about 8.8 million people.Such reworking of statistics, though, often confounds policy makers who find they have been making decisions based on one set of assumptions, only to find that a different picture is more accurate.",1,0.0,1.0,633

One possible option is to take equity stakes, such as buying preferred stock, under terms that are favorable to the institution.While details are still being discussed, the program would most likely be voluntary and aimed at encouraging healthy institutions to participate. Under one scenario, banks could come to Treasury and ask for an injection rather than having Treasury determine which banks would get an infusion. Treasury is also discussing a plan in which the government would inject capital into firms that raise a certain amount of money on their own from the private sector.Any program would include incentives for firms to participate, such as the government paying favorable prices for any equity stake.

Economists continued to nudge higher their estimates of the probability of a recession over the next 12 months; on average, they put the likelihood at 26%, up from 20% in June and 15% in February.Economists, on average, forecast GDP growth at a 2.8% annual rate for the third quarter, the first time their forecast for that quarter has been under 3% since the economic-forecasting survey first asked about the period in November 2005. While their forecast is slightly above the 2.5% real GDP growth recorded in the second quarter, it is well below the 5.6% growth in the first quarter and average annual growth rate of 3.2% from 2003 to 2005. The economists forecast growth slowing to a 2.6% rate in the fourth quarter, and staying at that rate for the first half of 2007.

Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again.

The returns are measured in U.S. dollars and include price, income and currency changes for bonds with remaining maturities of at least one year.Even some of the savviest money managers in the global bond market took their lumps in the first nine months.

Over the next decade, the forecasters expect 2.5% annual increases in the consumer-price index.But the Philadelphia Fed cautioned that two-thirds of the new forecasts were received before the government reported a surprisingly sharp increase in the CPI in April.As they have in previous surveys, the forecasters said they expect the year 2000 computer glitch to increase inflation-adjusted growth by an average of 0.3 percentage point this year and shave 0.3 point off growth early next year.

A military stalemate, coupled with an interruption in oil supplies, could plunge the economy into a deeper recession as inflation is ignited, interest rates climb, federal budget deficits balloon, real estate values plummet and consumer confidence collapses.Initially, experts expect a period of confusion as people try to figure out the course of the fighting.

East South Central and Great Lakes states showed the biggest gains as their stabilizing manufacturing sectors prompted workers to go ahead with delayed home-buying plans.

1043,"Bond Investors Fear That Federal Reserve Moves To Lift Economy Hurt Treasurys in Long Term. NEW YORK -- The prospect that the Federal Reserve could avert a recession through its aggressive easing of monetary policy is tolling a bearish knell for Treasurys.Last week, the Fed unexpectedly cut interest rates by a half percentage point, its fourth rate reduction of that size this year. That pushed the Federal funds rate, or overnight bank lending level, down to 4.5%.Bond investors always fear that returns on fixed-income securities such as Treasurys could be eroded in the long term if stronger growth is accompanied by higher inflation. Thus, in their view, what's good for the economy isn't necessarily healthy for the Treasurys market.Reflecting such fears, the 30-year Treasury bond Friday ended at about its highest yield of the year so far, or 5.793%. Its price, which moves inversely to its yield, was down 3/32 point from late Thursday at 94 1/32.Meantime, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 2/32 point, or 62 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 26/32.

1044,"Fairness and the Capital Tax Fetish. Friday's weak employment report reminds us anew of the flagging U.S. economic recovery. While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends. (The actual law reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 15%.)",1,0.0,1.0,759

The failure of the White House to promote an aggressive economic recovery plan may severely imperil GOP chances of holding on to the House and taking back control of the Senate in 2002. As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums.

Mom is partial to chicken soup, Uncle Pete prefers a shot of Jack Daniels and over at the National Association of Manufacturers they like to prescribe a weak U.S. dollar.With the U.S. trade deficit still large, the weak-dollar boys are back selling their elixir to Congress. Our old friend Jerry Jasinowski, head of NAM, was his typically laid-back self this week, explaining that an ""overvalued"" dollar ""is decimating U.S. manufactured-good exports, artificially stimulating imports and putting hundreds of thousands of American workers out of work."" How it managed to cause all of this mayhem while the economy was growing by some 5.8% in the first quarter must constitute a miracle. Either that, or maybe a strong greenback isn't quite the economic disaster he claims.The U.S. had a robust currency all throughout the 1990s when times were flush. The same was true for most of the 1980s, though we recall similar moaning about the Reagan dollar. The worst recent decade for U.S. economic policy was the 1970s, when the Nixon and Carter Treasuries decided to take NAM's advice and debase the dollar. Nirvana did not arrive.NAM's argument isn't economic policy so much as special pleading. Its members have to cope with rugged foreign competition, and they're looking for some government relief. They figure that the inefficient steelmakers got theirs -- tariffs -- so it's only fair that they now get a similar break. A dollar devaluation would be a kind of universal tariff on imports.You'd think Mr. Jasinowski would worry about the company he's keeping here. His allies include the AFL-CIO, that free-market paragon, and in the Senate the likes of Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, who has never met a tax or regulation he didn't like.

From Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Kohl's Corp. and Gap Inc., almost every major retailer reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings this week, and the results will be the final word on whether holiday shoppers were naughty or nice to the country's chain stores.Despite cold, snowy weather that walloped major swaths of the country in January, and uneven sales throughout the sector in December, the early consensus is that retailers for the most part posted solid earnings growth for the quarter. That's due in part to a robust November that lured shoppers with discounts galore as well as the retailers' ability to keep inventories and expenses in line after having tough lessons learned during the recession.That's the good news. With mounting prices on everything from fuel and food to cotton, retailers still are expected to offer muted full-year earnings guidance for 2011. Broad inflation hasn't beset clothing makers and sellers in almost two decades and rising costs will pose a quandary for stores: Do they pass those higher costs onto still-strapped consumers, who may in turn buy less? Or do they absorb some of the cost and take a hit to their gross profit margins?The first half of the year poses additional challenges, particularly for department stores and discounter Target Corp. They will be lapping their toughest sales comparisons from a year ago.""Most companies will provide conservative, cautiously optimistic guidance due to increasingly tough comparisons, erratic consumer spending trends (with a growing divide between wealthy and poor) and perhaps most importantly, apparel inflation,"" Bill Dreher, retail analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a recent report.",1,0.3167,0.6833,863

1065,"Why Dollar May Be Set for a Rebound. Beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately. But the greenback may be about to get off the mat.The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns.",1,0.30700000000000005,0.693,871

That is based on the premise that Dow transports have a symbiotic link with the Dow industrials, since the industrials make the goods the economy needs and the transports move those goods around the country. Basically, to have a balanced economy one can't work without the other.Investors relied on continued strong growth in China and the strengthening recovery in the U.S. to cushion the blow to U.S. stocks when the European sovereign-debt crisis first started to unfold.

LazearAs Washington debates the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many lawmakers have fallen into a logical trap of their own making. Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years.

The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, pointed to a statement by the Fed after a policy meeting in late June.

Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.Such provisions -- requiring signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards banning child labor and prison labor and permitting union organizing, as well as requiring enforcement of their own environmental laws -- had been included in the final trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress.",1,0.3337,0.6663,984

Exports fell in January to $35.54 billion from a revised $35.89 billion in December, while imports dropped to $41.3 billion from a revised $41.89 billion.Although exports declined slightly, they continue to be a source of frustration for U.S. manufacturers.

President KennedyUas warning that we face a 7 per cent unemployment rate even without a recession unless we step up our rate of economic growth ought to waken the whole country to the importance of a reduction now in the war-born tax rates that are dragging down the national economy.Tiie consequences of a slow rate of growth become more understandable then staled in human terms of rising unemployment. As the President pointed out, an economy expanding at the rate of 3 per cent is producing jobs at the rate of 10 million in 15 years while the civilian labor force is growing at the rate of 12 million in 15 years. Even with relative prosperity, the result is going to be rising unemployment. The country lost as much by the idleness of those willing but unable to find work in 1962, the President told an audience in Chicago last Saturday, as it would lose from shut-ing down the whole country and suspending all production, services and pay for three weeks. This is an intolerable waste which a civilized state cannot countenance.200.000	jobs a year, from the schools which will put 26 million new young workers on the labor market in the 60s, from automation which is enabling 800,000 fewer workers to produce 20 per cent more manufactured goods.There are many specific projects required to take care of the particular needs of different pools of labor, but none of these narrow approaches will have the total effect on employment that could be achieved by a tax cut of $10 billion which the President has recommended. To attack separately the problem of each idle group, in the long run, will be as ineffective as meeting the problems of a leaky roof with a bucket for each drip. Some of this may have to be done, in areas and age-groups and labor elements with special and peculiar problems that even relatively full employment will not solve. But this is a clean-up job, a mopping-up operation, a bit of social tidying up to be done in addition to raising general employment to acceptable levels.Such benefits as those contemplated in the bill to set up a Youth Conservation Corps and a Home Town Youth Corps for example are only patches on the main problem.

Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases.

Author: Alan GreenspanAn urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008.

1111,"Despite Rally, Worries Over Inflation Remain --- Economists Search For Better Indicators Than the Jobs Report. NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's ""relief"" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds.""The fixation on the `big' overall number of new jobs isn't sane,"" says one trader, disgruntled after a day of fielding more calls than he says he gets in an average week, all from clients seeking insight into a single figure.",1,0.3028,0.6972,1182

In addition to the drop of oil prices below $50 a barrel and the resolution of a bitterly fought presidential campaign, the government reported recently that hiring in October was stronger than expected, all factors that should underpin confidence.""Consumers will remain spending-minded,"" said Richard Curtin, the Michigan economist who oversees the confidence survey.

Moreover, slower economic growth, higher interest rates and increased federal outlays all could swell the deficit.Reagan administration budget officials previously have said they expect a fiscal 1987 deficit in the range of $175 billion to $180 billion.

From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy.

Could record levels of government spending, waves of new regulation and political credit allocation, and unprecedented monetary stimulus re-ignite growth? The results have been rolling in, and they represent what increasingly looks like an historic mistake that deserves to be called the Keynesian growth discount.***The latest evidence is yesterday's disappointing report of 1.8% in first quarter GDP.

However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump.While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent.""It looks pretty favorable to me,"" said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. ""You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply.

That was more than double the 1.7% rate of the previous quarter, and a good indication that the underlying potential of the economy remains strong.In the 12 months through September, nonfarm productivity grew 5.3%, its fastest rate in 19 years. Economists have attributed the gains to increased efficiencies from computers and the Internet, as well as the fact that employees that remain after a wave of layoffs tend to be more skilled. Although labor costs are rising, output is rising more than enough to compensate.Such strong productivity doesn't necessarily change the short-term economic outlook, which remains somewhat gloomy. But it does suggest that corporate profits will continue to improve and that inflation will remain in check -- both of which are important if the economy is to get back on track.When a company boosts productivity, it can squeeze more output from its existing workers without drastically increasing costs.

Higher energy prices, a lousy housing market and tighter credit continue to put the squeeze on consumers -- and Wal-Mart and Home Depot are feeling their pain.Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. ""It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,"" he said. ""The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been."" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an ""ebb tide in low-end consumer spending."" Goldman Sachs faulted ""the tougher macro environment"" for making the company's turnaround ""even tougher to enact,"" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's ""efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season.""

Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports.

1157,"The 'Conundrum' Explained. In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.---Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time.",1,0.3874,0.6126,1423
1158,"U.S. News: Hopes for a Turnaround Grow Dimmer As Worried Consumers Save, Don't Spend. Americans are earning more money -- but socking it away and not spending, undermining hopes for a consumer-driven rebound.The personal saving rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, jumped to 4.4% in June from 4% a month earlier and a recent low of 3.2% in November, the government said Tuesday, as consumers squirreled away cash amid the weak economy.Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June. Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.""This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy,"" said Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

Our old zero-sum assumptions - profits and productivity versus the birds and the trees - have given way to a new understanding of the relationships between economics and ecology. ""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency. Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others. To that extent, the notion of ""greener"" companies can be a win-win proposition, with salutary effects for both business and the earth.That's an underlying message from Frances Cairncross, who argues in Costing the Earth that the partnership of clear-sighted economic policies and resourceful companies can survive, even thrive, in the new era of global environmental concern.As environmental editor for the British magazine the Economist, Cairncross has a perspective rooted firmly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, where ""government regulation"" hasn't yet earned the same public scorn as ""acid rain.""

Earnings at several major banks rebounded from the heavy losses in the second quarter that resulted from industrywide increases in loan-loss reserves.Sharply lower loan-loss provisions, tax benefits and some one-time gains helped to buoy third-quarter earnings rises at the banks, particularly Chicago-based Continental Illinois Corp., where earnings rose 46% from a year earlier.

1165,"Some on Wall Street See Slower Growth --- Asian Turmoil, Concern On Consumer Spending Cited. A number of prominent Wall Street economists are cutting their estimates for U.S. economic growth in 1998, in part because of the turmoil in Southeast Asia but also due to some domestic concerns.The new estimates -- most still predicting moderate growth, yet trimming the growth rate by 0.5 percentage point or even more -- are based on a growing belief that U.S. exports to Asia will decline as economic growth there slows. In addition, there's a concern that U.S. consumer spending is weakening even as corporations and retailers continue to expand. Most of the revisions have come in the past week, following a sharp decline in many world markets, and despite a sharp rebound on Wall Street and elsewhere.The downward revisions to gross domestic product-the government's primary barometer of economic growthcame from economists at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., ISI Group and several others. The size of their revisions were unusually large, even for market-oriented economists who react quickly to changing economic news.Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest banking concern, raised eyebrows when it told clients Tuesday that it revised its 1998 forecast to between 1% and 1.5% from 1.5% to 2%. The bank's chief economist, John Lipsky, began his special report, ""Reassessing Risks to the 1998 Outlook,"" by saying even though ""relative calm has returned to global financial markets,"" he felt it would be ""premature to presume that this chapter is closed.""Although Mr. Lipsky's sentiments were echoed by many other economists on Wall Street, academic and corporate economists are taking a more sanguine view of the economy. The monthly consensus forecast due next week from Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an Alexandria, Va., firm that collects the forecasts of about 50 economists and calculates a consensus, is not likely to show much change, if any, from its early October consensus. The Blue Chip consensus forecast published last month called for growth of 2.5% in 1998, down from an expected 3.6% in 1997.

His annual year-end forecast is based on the dollar's historic trading pattern in Decembers.

For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do.",1,0.0,1.0,1524

NEW YORK -- Economic storm clouds are clearing, but the streets are still slippery.That's the midyear consensus of 40 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Although the recession is ending, they say, the recovery will be much weaker than the typical rebound since World War II. Many predict little or no change in the unemployment rate over the next several months.Indeed, many analysts say the difference between recovery and recession will be so subtle that people who aren't economists may have difficulty seeing it.""A lot of business people are saying to me: What recovery?"" says Stuart Hoffman, senior vice president at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh. That's likely to remain a reasonable question all year, he says, because there are ""many speed bumps that will keep us moving very slowly on the road to recovery.""Stiff tax increases imposed by many state and local governments this year are among the economic speed bumps Mr. Hoffman and many other analysts cite. They also point to the nation's low savings rate, and the huge debts amassed by consumers, businesses and government in the 1980s.

The divergent policy paths taken by the world's advanced economies provide lessons for global leaders navigating difficult post-crisis environments.The U.S. and U.K. appear to have gotten something right, while the eurozone and Japan have fumbled.

The eurozone rate has climbed in the past few years to 11.5%, while Japan's economy has fallen back into recession.The American and British central banks embraced aggressive easy-money policies early on.

1180,"The Outlook: An Economic Slowdown Brings Its Problems. NEW YORK -- The financial markets for weeks have been hoping for an economic slowdown. The economy has been roaring along at a pace that makes analysts worry about a future upsurge of inflation. Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength.

He was one of five Fed officials to speak so far this week. Their comments, while more upbeat than they have been for months, suggest they are less impressed with the run of positive economic reports, ranging from capital-goods orders to home sales, than private forecasters and investors.Mr. Santomero, for example, said it may take longer than expected for companies to rebuild inventories, something optimistic analysts are counting on to generate higher production and an imminent recovery. He said consumer spending, though resilient so far, could retrench if big layoffs persist.A Wall Street Journal poll of 54 forecasters found that two-thirds expect the economy to grow in the current quarter, and almost all expect growth in the next quarter.But Fed officials see more risks. Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said in a speech that while the consensus forecast is ""the most probable outcome . . . I think there's a good chance that the economy may be at least a little softer than the consensus over the next year or so."" He cited the risk that continued weak profits will hold back business investment. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Jack Guynn said the economy would probably contract ""for another quarter or two.""

Retailers in particular said activity had picked up in October and early November, and many were optimistic about the current holiday season. The Chicago district went so far as to call it ""the best performance in eight years.""Badly battered consumer confidence also seemed to be on the mend in many areas, a trend that respondents in Boston and Chicago linked to the end of the presidential election campaign. In New York, however, retailers attributed the somewhat brighter picture to promotional efforts rather than to any meaningful revival in the economy.Manufacturers in about half of the Fed districts said things are looking up, albeit generally quite modestly. Ongoing cutbacks in the defense industry remain a drag on the recovery in some regions. And while indicators from Dallas are strong, and Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago reported small gains, many industrial concerns in the New York district and California continue to experience weak demand.Construction and real estate remain ""a tale of two markets,"" the report said, with improvements in the residential sector and continued stagnation on the commercial side.

The U.S. trade deficit rose to an all-time high of $61 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, dealing a fresh blow to hopes that the gap will start to shrink soon in response to the decline in the dollar.Exports stayed relatively flat, totaling $100.5 billion in February, just 0.1 percent, or $100 million, above the previous month's level. At the same time, the nation's pattern of importing more and more goods continued unchecked, as foreign products purchased by Americans rose 1.6 percent, or $2.6 billion, to $161.5 billion, led by oil, autos and consumer goods.The politically sensitive U.S. deficit with China narrowed in February to $13.9 billion from January's $15.3 billion level. But critics of China pointed out that the combined figure for those two months was 47 percent above the same period last year and said the report will fuel growing sentiment in Congress for a tougher policy on Beijing's trade practices.The overall gap was a record -- by itself nothing new, because the monthly trade deficit has smashed through previous highs eight times since the start of last year. But yesterday's report deepened concern that the flow of goods across U.S. borders does not seem to be responding to the dollar's fall, even though that decline has continued for three years.A cheaper dollar is supposed to spur sales of U.S. exports by making American goods more attractive to foreign purchasers, and reduce Americans' appetite for foreign products by making them more expensive.

The dollar remains in heavy demand from banks around the world, a sign trust among banks remains fragile.While a number of indicators show credit markets are thawing, economists, central bankers and investors are paying keen attention to the rate at which foreign banks are pulling dollar deposits out of their U.S. branches. That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans. A large gap has appeared between the one-month and three-month Libor, in what analysts say is a worrying sign that banks remain reluctant to make longer-term loans to one another.

WASHINGTON -- Consumer price increases have slowed sharply, helping reassure economists that a boost in short-term interest rates isn't imminent.After a worrisome rise in prices in the first four months of the year, recent evidence suggests inflation is again in check. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose a tiny 0.1% in July. The index didn't change in June and increased only 0.1% in May.Analysts have been watching closely for signs of problem inflation for a hint as to whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates.

But they may now be approaching the time when they have to cut bigger paychecks to compete. What's more, they appear to be getting ready for this.The unemployment rate has been falling swiftly, dropping to 6.3% in May from 7.5% a year earlier. But there's an open question about how much slack there is in the job market. Some 37.2% of the working-age population is out of the labor force now, compared with 34% when the recession started in 2007. And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly. So far, that hasn't been happening. Average hourly earnings were up just 2.1% in May versus a year earlier, and the Labor Department on Tuesday reported that, when adjusted for inflation, they were actually a shade lower.But companies think they will soon be paying more. This month, a quarterly survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine showed that U.S. chief financial officers expect wages and salaries at their companies to increase 3% over the next 12 months. Last June, they had expected year-ahead gains of 2.5%.

High interest rates are the stick that drove Congress and the White House to negotiate all spring over the budget and that may yet push Congress to take some action to reduce the upcoming deficit.The theory is that lower prospective deficits will reduce pressure on the financial markets, reduce fear of future inflation, and for both reasons bring a reduction in interest rates that will let the economy off the floor of recession.All sides agree that high interest rates are a leading cause of the economyUas problems. But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates. But he has also taken a contrary view and, citing cases in the Midwest where local banks have cut their rates, has argued that interest rates should come down because the inflation rate has come down so rquch in recent months.There are several lines of argument against the interest rate theory on which the budget negotiators have been operating.",1,0.35250000000000004,0.6475,1736

U.S. gasoline prices rose last month by an average five cents a gallon even as production increases by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drove down crude-oil prices. The culprits: bad weather and production problems.But despite average pump prices last month of $1.45 for a gallon of regular unleaded, prices have begun to taper off, and economists said the gasoline-price rise likely has run out of steam for the rest of the year.""The recent jump in gas prices will turn out to be a blip,"" said Dave Costello, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy. Barring a war with Iraq -- which could crimp global crude-oil supplies to refineries -- prices should remain around $1.40 a gallon through December, Mr. Costello said.Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and other production problems drove up wholesale prices during October. In the Northeast, a shortage of methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive used to reduce emissions and add octane to gasoline, put pressure on prices.

Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry, but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.Analysts say results for the December quarter will illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard software such as programs written for Unix operating systems.

1242,"Recession's Hidden Virtues. We are all waiting, it seems, for the next recession. Everyone knows that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and so another recession is inevitable. Some indicators suggest that it might be sooner rather than later. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index has declined for three straight months. In March, 30 percent of respondents said jobs are ""plentiful""; now that's only 24 percent. All this inspires much foreboding, because a recession is widely regarded as a calamity or something close to it.Just last week, the Federal Reserve cut its key overnight interest rate for the second time since August. It now stands at 4.5 percent, down from its recent peak of 5.25 percent. Although the economy grew at a strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, most economists regard this as an aberration. They expect slower growth or a recession, because three powerful forces are assaulting the economic expansion.First, housing. Its collapse deepens. Economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley notes that sales of new and existing homes have dropped 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks of more than two years ago. As supplies of unsold homes grow, real estate prices continue to fall. One index finds that prices in August were down 4.4 percent nationally from a year earlier.Second, oil prices. They're approaching $100 a barrel. Even before the latest price increases, energy costs rose to 6.2 percent of consumer spending in the second quarter; that's up from 4.5 percent in 2002, notes consultant Jack Lavery, a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch. Higher energy costs will continue to weaken purchasing power for other goods and services, he says.Third, credit problems. As lenders and investors have suffered losses on subprime mortgages -- loans to weaker borrowers -- they've tightened lending standards for other borrowers. With the economy slowing, Diane Vazza of Standard & Poor's expects bond defaults to rise among shakier corporate borrowers, especially companies dependent on strong consumer spending (retailers, fast-food chains, entertainment firms).",1,0.33330000000000004,0.6667,1925

Rising rates and a banner year for stocks could lift earnings at some large companies that have made an arcane but significant change to the way their pension plans are valued.Companies including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. could show stronger results than some expect when they report fourth-quarter earnings in coming weeks. They and about 30 other companies in the past few years switched to ""mark-to-market"" pension accounting to make it easier for investors to gauge plan performance.With the switch, pension gains and losses flow into earnings sooner than under the old rules, which are still in effect and allow companies to smooth out the impact over several years. Companies that switch to valuing assets at up-to-date market prices may incur more volatility in their earnings, but it offers a more current picture of a pension plan's health and its contribution to the bottom line.In 2011 and 2012, that change hurt the companies' earnings, largely because interest rates were falling at the time.

The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.reaction to the closing of steel mills in OhioUas Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. ItUas the first of four increments scheduled for 1979.

They don't always match up because they are based on different samples, but in the long run they tend to line up fairly closely. The December payroll survey released Friday showed a modest gain of 103,000 jobs. But the prior two months were revised up by 70,000 jobs. The surprisingly weak November figure moved from a gain of 39,000 jobs, as reported last month, to a gain of 71,000 jobs.Why such a large jump in the revision?

After years of skyrocketing increases, national health care spending rose only 6.4 percent in 1994, the ""slowest growth rate recorded in more than three decades,"" the Medicare Office of National Health Statistics reported yesterday.The figures, published in the magazine Health Affairs, show that health spending by all public and private sources totaled $949.4 billion in calendar year 1994, the latest year for which data have been calculated, or $3,510 for each person in the United States.From 1988 to 1992 the nation experienced double-digit and near-double-digit increases in health spending each year. The rate eased to 7 percent in 1993 and the growth rate now has fallen again to 6.4 percent.

Low inflation also is a contributing factor.The new figures appear to support the arguments of health analysts like Gail Wilensky, who chairs the Congressional Physician Payment Review Commission, and GOP members of Congress, like Rep.

The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk.

DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers, in a mood of caution, are planning to build fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than in any last quarter since the recession-plagued final period of 1982.While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's ""soft landing"" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. ""The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery,"" said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years.",1,0.0,1.0,2070

Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program.

In his Newsweek column, ""Inflation and Jobs"" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that ""unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,"" so that if a central bank ""cured"" unemployment by inflating, it ""will have unemployment later.""

1270,"The Fed's Blueprint for Financial Control; Dan Tarullo's recent speech suggests that the central bank is intent on wide regulation of U.S. capital markets.. Much of the financial world hangs on Janet Yellen's every word, looking for policy portents in language that is crafted to be circumspect about the central bank's plans. A more useful place to look for guidance on regulation of the financial system is Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor and its point man for banking reform. Mr. Tarullo gave a speech in Chicago on May 8 that was as unsettling as it was, by the Fed's inscrutable standards, unguarded.Addressing the Chicago Fed Bank Structure Conference, Mr. Tarullo proposed that the central bank must ""broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors."" This expansion of regulatory authority would take the Fed far beyond the current power it exercises thanks to the Dodd-Frank law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises. The casualties of such an expansion could include small- and medium-size banks.Under Dodd-Frank, ultimate financial regulatory power resides with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a council of 10 regulators chaired by the Treasury and which includes the Fed chairman. The FSOC can designate asset managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, or even broker-dealers as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a classification that puts an institution under the Fed's regulatory authority. The council has already designated the large insurers AIG and Prudential as SIFIs, and it has many more nonbank financial companies in its sights.The council's moves are part of a larger blueprint that Mr. Tarullo has now laid out. In the Chicago speech, he proposed ditching complex Basel III capital and liquidity regulations and reducing regulations on small banks. The new system he outlined would use simpler, Basel I capital charges for small banks, on grounds that the failure of these banks would pose no threat to financial stability. Larger regional banks would require slightly elevated regulatory standards, but nothing too complex.Once a bank joins a ""club"" of the 80 largest institutions, however, the Federal Reserve should be its regulator, Mr. Tarullo said, and regulation should focus on annual stress tests. The very largest institutions, U.S. global banks and nonbank SIFIs, would receive the most intrusive Fed oversight and be required to satisfy the full range of new international macroprudential rules.",1,0.34430000000000005,0.6557,2076
1271,"The Afternoon Report: The Newest Numbers. Economy watchers, trying to triangulate the economy's position amid credit risks and the housing slump, found fresh numbers and economic utterances to crunch and parse today.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- which publishes comparable social and economic stats for some 30 countries -- reported Wednesday that the U.S. economic slowdown will be significant, as the real estate crisis continues. Housing ""is set to exert a longer and more potent than expected drag"" on the U.S. economy, said Jean-Philippe Cotis, chief economist for the Paris-based economic think tank. Consumers will also be tested by ""mortgage rate resets, tighter credit standards, weaker collaterals and slower job creation."" In a press briefing, Mr. Costis also said he expects the Federal Reserve to ease rates sooner rather than later. Another ominous, yet inconclusive, indicator of the direction of the U.S. economy out early Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report, said that jobs in the private sector rose by 38,000 in August, much less than expectations. This data tidbit shined one of the first statistical spotlights on the economy in August, when the worries over exposure to subprime securities spooked investors out of credit markets. Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned that the ADP report ""gives a picture of the labor market for the week of Aug. 12, only part way through the market turmoil and before employment could really react to the ongoing credit crunch. More weakness could well be yet to come.""Also out Wednesday were housing numbers from the National Association of Realtors. The group's index of pending sales of existing homes decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2% in July from June, the industry group said Wednesday. The NAR index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 16.1% below the level of July 2006. An NAR statement accompanying the data release also suggested existing-home sales will likely sag more as mortgage disruptions tied to credit concerns work their way into the housing market. BNP Paribas economists noted that ""most worryingly is that this report is clearly 'pre-turmoil', reflecting resale transactions agreed in July, so before August's financial market turmoil, lurch higher in jumbo mortgage rates and the freezing over of much of the mortgage market. How bad next month's pending sales index (and this month's new home sales report) might be is really quite frightening."" Still more economic reports are on tap for later today, when the Federal Reserve will release its ""beige book"" report. Concerns over the credit crunch and statements from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week will put extra weight on the regularly published collection of on-the-ground business anecdotes from the Fed's 12 regional banks.Housing figures proved particularly difficult for investors to digest, and major indexes reversed course after Tuesday's rally.

What the editorial did not say, however, is why the politicians can so easily get away with their demagoguery: the complexity of economics.For example, it is easy for people who have jobs to see those jobs being preserved by government interference and impossible for people who are looking for jobs to see jobs that were never created in the first place because of that same government interference.When we wonder about the slowness of the current job recovery, we should be thinking about all the government actions that interfere with job creation, including payroll taxes, protectionist quotas and subsidies to favored businesses, excessive regulations that weaken our companies, massive federal spending and deficits, and overly generous unemployment benefits that subsidize voluntary unemployment and discourage employment flexibility.In the long run, your editorial on outsourcing is correct. But as John Maynard Keynes said, ""In the long run, we are all dead.""In the short run, a government of the people, by the people and for the people should ameliorate the worst effects of offshoring on U.S. workers rather than accelerate offshoring for the benefit of U.S. corporations.",1,0.3603,0.6397,2103

The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the federal deficit for April soared to $82.7 billion, the largest imbalance for that month on record. That was significantly higher than last year's April deficit of $20 billion and above the $30 billion deficit that private-sector economists had expected.The government generally runs surpluses in April, as millions of taxpayers file their income tax returns. But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps. The final third reflects added government spending on the $787 billion stimulus bill and the $700 billion financial bailout.",1,0.3125,0.6875,2144

Easy Money Tugs Two Ways at Trade GapThe trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods.",1,0.0,1.0,2145

An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy.

But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up.

And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year.

Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine.

WASHINGTON--The breakdown in deficit-reduction talks between the White House and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) could immediately increase the risk that Standard & Poor's takes the unprecedented step of lowering its top-notch rating of U.S. government debt.The credit-rating firm has warned repeatedly that it could move to downgrade U.S. debt if it believes any deficit-reduction deal isn't robust enough to change the country's trajectory of future debt growth. A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening.""If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need,"" Mr. Obama said Friday evening.",1,0.0,1.0,2236

Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- The dollar suffered a broad-based setback after signs that inflationary pressures remain modest curtailed hopes that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise interest rates.The dollar's selloff was sparked by the release of a May consumer- price index that came mostly in line with expectations. While the overall CPI registered the biggest monthly jump in 31/2 years, rising 0.6%, the more closely watched core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.2%. Expectations were for a 0.5% gain in the headline number, with a 0.2% rise in core prices.Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan threw even more cold water on speculation that U.S. rates were headed sharply higher when he played down the risk of inflation. The Fed chief, testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee on his nomination to a fifth term as chairman, said the central bank's ""general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead.""Thus, Mr. Greenspan said, he still expects to be able to lift interest rates at a ""measured"" pace this year, though he reaffirmed that the Fed is prepared to raise rates more aggressively if necessary.",1,0.3529,0.6471,2284

In the past year, a group of individuals interested in investment banking and the stock market, with the aid of Washington legal advisers, has been quietly pushing a proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains.A Senate finance subcommittee already has held little-publicized hearings on the proposal, and it is now being promoted before the House Ways and Means Committee as a UItax reform.UThe essence of this proposal is that the proportion of a capital gain included in taxable incomeUOwhich now is only 50 per cent, of the gainUOshould he reduced still further. The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families.

1303,"Home Prices Are Still Too High; They would have to decline another 20% just to get back to the historical trend line.. Author: Peter D. SchiffMost economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.",1,0.0,1.0,2305

Usually, the bond encounters strong market resistance in moving below 8 percent.Why has it been difficult for the long bond to move down through 8 percent, and what will it take for long rates to fall to the low levels of 1987?

At that time, the bond traded at 7.27 percent to 7.88 percent, with the lower yields occurring in January 1987. Then, as the economy began to improve and inflation began to rise, rates rose until Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.Inflation is the first part of the answer. The consumer price index, a widely followed measure of inflation, rose a mere 1.1 percent from December 1985 to December 1986, helped by a 30.7 percent decline in energy costs. The CPI was up only 3.8 percent the previous year.As a result of two good inflation years back to back, interest rates began to trend lower in February 1986, touching briefly at 7.16 percent in July, and then ambulating between 7.16 percent and 7.77 percent before closing the year at 7.33 percent.

The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say. A growing share of students are commuting from home rather than living on campus, for example, according to a report issued earlier this year by SLM Corp., the largest private student lender, also known as Sallie Mae.An improving economy and stock market are also likely contributing to families borrowing less, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, a Las Vegas-based firm that tracks financial aid and student loans.

Total imports rose 9.2%.The large January deficit makes it clear that the easing of the nation's trade problems at the end of last year was temporary, reflecting a slowdown in imports as a result of sluggish economic growth in the third quarter.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the 10% rise in the value of the dollar last year, plus the 9% jump since December, could push the deficit to a record $140 billion this year. The trade deficit in 1984 was a record $123.31 billion, compared with $69.39 billion in 1983, the previous record.A strong dollar can widen the trade deficit by lowering the cost of imports to U.S. buyers and raising the cost of exports to foreign buyers.

WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton administration is willing to consider delaying its proposed increases in personal income taxes to shield the economy from harm this year, but said he doubts that will be necessary.President Clinton's economic plan calls for making the increases in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount ""What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs,"" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been ""more than I anticipated."" On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal. The new energy tax, for instance, could be phased in more rapidly; currently, it is to be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 1994.",1,0.3220000000000001,0.6779999999999999,2377

[Fourth in a Series]Economist Robert Hall has been puzzling over a thorny question for nearly a year: What do you call an economy that has started expanding again but keeps destroying jobs?Mr. Hall heads a committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group in Cambridge, Mass., that declares when U.S. recessions begin and end. In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression.

Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year.

But most thought a sharp drop in petroleum prices could cause serious problems for a number of important sectors of the American economy, including the oil, banking, coal, natural gas and synthetic fuels industries.UIIn the long term, lower oil prices would mean greater economic growth for the American economy,U said Eric Zausner, who heads the energy division of the consulting firm Booz-Allen & Hamilton.

WASHINGTON -- Despite continuing signs of economic momentum, the Federal Reserve still isn't convinced that growth is so strong that it is straining capacity and threatening higher inflation.After a two-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. Whether it tightens rates at its next policy session Aug. 20 -- as many economists expect -- depends on what signals the economy sends on prices and growth in the next few weeks.""There just wasn't enough evidence yet,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm. ""Core prices are still decelerating, and there are clear signs that the burst of strength in the second quarter will slow to a more sustainable level during the second half.""Over the next six weeks, the Fed will get critical new economic data, beginning this morning with new payroll and unemployment numbers. Also due soon are consumer and wholesale prices, retail sales, wages and the first estimate of total second-quarter growth. Many economists expect that number to exceed a 4% annual rate, compared with 2.2% in the first quarter -- well above the level thought to be sustainable without higher inflation, given today's tight labor markets.In their deliberations, Fed policy makers had to look ahead into next year and would have tightened rates if they saw a clear threat of unsustainable growth leading to rising inflation. One factor that may have helped forestall a rate increase was the rising value of the dollar compared with the yen and mark, a rise that will brake the economy by cooling the booming export sector.",1,0.3420000000000001,0.6579999999999999,2531

1348,"The Outlook: Recession-Free 1988? Don't Bet the Ranch. NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record.

1351,"There's No Escaping Hauser's Law. Even amoebas learn by trial and error, but some economists and politicians do not. The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%. Yet taxes as a share of GDP have remained within a relatively narrow range as a percent of GDP in the entire post-World War II period.",1,0.3077,0.6923,2566

Last year, gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at an inflation-adjusted 3.3%.However, as the housing and auto slumps have deepened while business spending has started to wane, economists are taking another whack at their GDP forecasts. Earlier this month, the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal called for GDP to grow about 2.3% in the first quarter, down from an estimate of 2.5% a month earlier. The forecast for the second quarter was unchanged at 2.4%. One-tenth of a percentage point in GDP amounts to about $13.5 billion.""The housing recession is likely to be a little deeper and much more prolonged than any of us have been thinking, and capital spending will be considerably weaker,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, which lowered its forecast of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.6% from 2.2%.Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting firm based in St. Louis, lowered its forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%. Economists at Morgan Stanley reduced their tracking of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.4% from 1.6% growth; the firm's estimate was as high as 2.2% in mid- March.",1,0.0,1.0,2647

Yesterday, First Bank Minneapolis trimmed its base rate on corporate loans to 12 1/4% from 12 1/2%. A smaller bank, National City Bank of Minneapolis, went a step further, cutting its rate to 12%. Most major banks currently are quoting a 12 1/2% rate.""We're going to have a 12% prime rate before the month is over and further declines in November to 11 1/2%,"" predicted Joseph Bench, a vice president and economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc. He said the Federal Reserve System has eased credit conditions in an attempt to bolster the economy.""The Fed is troubled by the abrupt downshift in economic growth, and it doesn't want it to snowball into a recession,"" he added.",1,0.3874,0.6126,2752

1388,"Fear of Growth: Economic Gains Spook Bond Buyers, but Risk Of Inflation Is Low --- In Fact, Some Experts Think Bigger Peril Is Weakness When Tax Rise Kicks In --- Bentsen's Mortgage-Rate Bet. Talk about nervous. The economy merely flexes some long-unused muscles and investors fall all over themselves heading for the exits.No doubt about it, the economy is putting on a modest show of strength. Cars and houses are selling better, shoppers are loosening their purse strings and more people are being put to work. If this keeps up, economists predict, the economy will grow at an annual rate of between 3% and 4% in the current quarter, the best since a burst of growth in the last quarter of 1992.But with long-term bond prices at lofty levels, interest rates at their lowest since the Treasury began selling 30-year bonds in 1977, and stock prices near record highs, early evidence of renewed growth seemed like the last thing investors wanted to see last week. To some it conjured up visions of tight supplies of goods and services, rising prices, and a Federal Reserve only too willing to fight inflation by raising interest rates to slow an overheating economy.The result: a startling weeklong sell-off in the bond market and a two-day plunge in stock prices. Suddenly interest rates were rising and stocks looked as if they were teetering on the edge of a bear market.""What is so amazing to me is that market psychology turned so quickly on such a small pickup in growth,"" marvels Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.",1,0.3306,0.6694,2758

Then, on Monday, after news that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates, the Dow drops 147 points.Looks like trouble, and the newspapers are full of stories about analysts predicting a slide. But later in the week, the Dow bounces back by more than 200 points after reports that economic growth is strong and inflation nowhere in sight -- except perhaps in the stock market itself.All the blather about the stock market being too high (or too low), about bulls and bears, about the latest GDP and CPI -- it's extraneous noise. Certainly, you should be alert to specific opportunities in individual stocks, and the economy and inflation sometimes influence the chances of, say, auto stocks or bank stocks that might be depressed.But what investors need to remember about the market as a whole are the simple things: In the short run stocks are wildly volatile, but in the long run they are no more risky than Treasury bonds and money market funds. If you need your money in the next seven years, you have no business putting a significant portion of your wealth in the stock market. If you can keep your money working for the long term, it makes sense to be in with both feet -- as long as you can sleep at night.",1,0.371,0.629,2760

1400,"What We Could Learn From Mexico. The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components.",1,0.0,1.0,2831

The August deficit was $6.53 billion.The Bush administration hailed the news as an indication of economic recovery.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which includes a number of China plays, lost an additional 2.3%, bringing its loss for November to 17%.The U.S. stock selloff on Wednesday included a 211.10-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the third straight drop. At 12799.04, the Dow is now up 2.7% on the year. It also is nearly 10% off its October highs -- the textbook definition of a ""correction"" that shakes speculative excess out of the market.""It's no longer a need for return,"" said Treasury-bond strategist John Spinello at Jefferies & Co. ""It's preserving your capital.""Stocks have often bounced after such corrections in the past. For now at least, investors seem to be heading somewhere else instead. The price of a benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained about $2.50 for each $1,000 invested Wednesday. That pushed its yield to 4.024%, its lowest level since September 2005.

1410,"Bush's Real Challenge: Rebuilding The Economy. IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House. Bush just might-if he now moves to set a more ambitious agenda.",1,0.3551,0.6449,2866

As a result, long-term interest rates rose and the value of the surging U.S. dollar strengthened further yesterday.Among those signs was an unusual interim report by researchers at the University of Michigan who survey U.S. consumer attitudes each month. While declining to release the exact figures, a survey official said the initial sampling of consumer sentiment this month showed such a sharp improvement that a special report was issued to the survey's clients.Many economists believe that plunging consumer sentiment, depressed by soaring energy prices and uncertainty over the Persian Gulf War, caused a large drop in buying that, in turn, was a major factor in the current recession.",1,0.0,1.0,2883
1414,"Raise Interest Rates, Make Grandma Smile. For America's 44 million senior citizens, plus tens of millions of others who are on the threshold of retirement, last month marked a watershed moment that is worth celebrating. At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy.",1,0.0,1.0,2891

That was the highest level since May 2008. Sales were up 38% from a year earlier.The sales jump comes amid a sharp escalation in mortgage rates, which began rising in late May.

He cited pent-up demand, a better labor market and stronger consumer confidence as factors behind the sales boost.Mortgage rates can hit new-home sales more quickly than sales of previously owned homes because the new-home figures are measured when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a new home.

Although the premium can be measured a number of ways, most experts agree that it has declined substantially in recent years, contributing to the stock market's climb to its highest prices relative to earnings in decades.In testimony to Congress Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said investors' optimism about strong profits has led to lower risk premiums in the stock and bond markets and warned of ""unwarranted expectations.""But William Dudley, director of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs, argues that longer-lasting, less-volatile business cycles have led to more stable and predictable corporate profits and declining volatility in stock prices relative to bond prices.",1,0.3305,0.6695,3006

As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record $37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled $100 billion in 12 million accounts; today, $5 trillion in 170 million accounts.Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are.The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold.

1453,"Board of Contributors: Goose the Money Supply. When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.",1,0.35650000000000004,0.6435,3056

Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: ""This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.""Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar.

At first glance, that's at odds with the Fed's main scenario for what the economy will do this year: Consumer spending should slow as a weakening housing market makes people feel poorer, but increased business investment -- in the form of capital-goods purchases and hiring -- should help keep the deceleration from becoming a disaster.Economists, however, warned against reading too much into the volatile monthly data, saying that longer-term trends still point toward slowing home sales and growing capital spending.

""Capital spending is a prime candidate.""New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in Southern states.

That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. ""People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,"" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. ""The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.""The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings.",1,0.3077,0.6923,3194
1482,"Dollar Weakens In Sluggish Day; Gold Gains $1.30. The U.S. dollar drifted lower against most major foreign currencies yesterday in lackluster trading.Uncertainty, more than any other mood, characterized currency markets, traders said. Dealers in the Far East and Europe were unwilling to take a strong stand on the dollar, and instead were waiting for the New York market to open after a three-day holiday weekend.But activity in New York was only marginally more lively, as traders had difficulty sifting through conflicting indicators.Early in the day in New York, the dollar was pushed briefly upward when traders interpreted the minutes of the October meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to indicate the Federal Reserve was concerned about a hard landing for the dollar and wouldn't significantly ease monetary policy. Such an easing would lead to lower U.S. interest rates which, in turn, would tend to weaken the dollar. The minutes were released late Friday.Then later in Washington, Treasury Secretary James Baker, in remarks before a global-monetary conference, said that the endeavor by the so-called Group of Five -- U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- to lower the dollar wasn't ""a one-shot"" effort. Reacting to the news, one trader at a big British bank said: ""Obviously, they're very serious about keeping the dollar down.""",1,0.30910000000000004,0.6909,3203

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, saying the U.S. economy ""appears to have regained some traction"" after ""moderating earlier this year.""The Fed said nothing to dissuade financial markets from anticipating another quarter-point rate increase before year end.The Fed's campaign to lift interest rates is intended not to slow the economy, but to raise rates from emergency lows in order to avoid creating an inflation problem in the future.

Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987.

Federal-funds futures, which price off Fed policy expectations, imply the target rate will be 0.5% by August 2015 versus near-zero today.But there still is a great deal of uncertainty on when ""liftoff,"" as Fed policy makers call it, will occur. That is largely because the unemployment rate doesn't seem to be fully capturing how much slack remains in the job market.There is no way to know how many of the people who left the labor force during the recession and its aftermath, and who therefore aren't counted among the unemployed, will return to the job hunt. That makes it hard to tell when wages, and inflation, might start to really heat up.",1,0.35540000000000005,0.6446,3313

And so we may conclude that if Congress now does the right thing quickly on tax policy, the market will rise.Problem is, the early indications we're getting is that Congress may enact a new tax bill using conventional means, such as tax credits, mainly to shore up the largest corporations. Incentives at the margin will be minimal. That is, half a loaf.The outlook would be considerably more worrisome had the market's indices spent the whole of yesterday in a steady, precipitous decline. The reality is that most of the day's 7.13% loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day.A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial.

The closure of the air transport system may have merely pitched several airlines toward inevitable dissolution, which would be reflected in yesterday's trading.That said, share prices generally rose in Europe, and Asia's losses were modest.

Investor reaction was mixed.Comerica Inc. and M&T Bank Corp. reported fewer new loans than expected and higher costs amid acquisitions, sending shares of the banks near their 52-week lows.In contrast, their larger rivals--U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.--reported strong demand from commercial borrowers and managed to keep their profit margin in the lending business from deteriorating amid low interest rates.

1511,"Economy Gives Social Security a Reprieve --- Latest Forecast Extends Trust Fund's Solvency By Three Years, to 2032. WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.",1,0.0,1.0,3337

But some analysts say the rejoicing may be out of place, because the jury is still out on the Fed's next move.The price spike on Friday, the last trading day before today, was triggered by bond-friendly employment news, which eased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.

1516,"Concerns Rising With Dollar's Continued Fall; Analysts Fear Rates Will Climb, Recovery Will Stall. With the economy expanding smartly, interest rates low and inflation in check, President Bush is sailing into the presidential election year with perhaps only a single dark economic cloud on the horizon: the shrinking U.S. dollar.Whether that cloud produces a nourishing rain shower -- in the form of swelling U.S. exports and a recovery of manufacturing jobs - - or a deluge of rising interest rates and soaring budget deficits is the subject of increasingly heated economic debate.Recent news of rapid third-quarter economic growth, rising consumer spending and climbing personal incomes did little to budge the dollar from its record lows against the 12-nation euro. The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets. That could slow the nascent economic recovery, swell the already-record federal budget deficit and possibly resurrect an economic problem unseen for nearly 20 years: inflation.",1,0.3115,0.6885,3357

1519,"The Market's Frame of Mind. To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery.",1,0.3388,0.6612,3361

When Labor Department data showed the index rose 0.3%, higher than the consensus forecast of 0.2%, they squared their positions, lifting the dollar.But no one was ready to take any big risks with the key U.S. data scheduled for release today, traders said.Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6935 marks, up from 1.6865 marks late Wednesday.

1529,"Some economists warn that inflation may be back to haunt the economy. The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it.

1536,"The Afternoon Report: Reckoning Rates. The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that ""the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed."" And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. ""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us."" In any event, investors will be surprised with anything other than a quarter-point rate cut today, as they were pegging the chances for such a snip -- via fed-funds futures -- at more than 90% early in the day---",1,0.30110000000000003,0.6989,3446

1552,"Golden warning. On Jan. 31, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it was lowering the federal-funds rate and the discount rate by one-quarter of 1%. In making the move, the Fed cited the moderation in economic growth and chose to ignore the warning of gold moving above $400 an ounce. As a consequence, the markets have given the Fed a very unsatisfactory grade for its latest rate cut. In the wake of this rate cut, the price of gold has pushed higher to $415 an ounce, long-term interest rates have moved higher, the yield curve has steepened, and the dollar has slipped against the mark and the yen. In other words, interest rates on bonds went up even though the cost of borrowing money fell. Bond investors said, in effect: Pay me more interest to bribe me to own the bonds.A rise in the price of gold is the best signal that we have to indicate that there is diminished confidence about the future purchasing-power reliability of money. The price of gold rises when the most savvy and suspicious investors believe the Fed has become a less reliable guardian of the value of our money. Or they may believe that in our democracy the president or Congress may pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. These suspicious investors would move out of dollars and into gold if they thought that the government was leaning on the Fed to lessen its commitment to price stability.Last week's interest rate cut raises questions about whether it might have been a politically motivated deal. It was unusual that the discount rate was cut by only one-quarter of 1% -- you have to go back to 1978 to see such a small change in the discount rate -- and yet six Fed banks (including all five of the banks whose presidents have an Federal Open Market Committee vote) requested the move. Based on minutes from the Dec. 19 FOMC meeting, there were some members who would have preferred to leave rates unchanged and were unsure, after the rate cut at that meeting, what the direction of the next rate move would be. Where were their voices at the January meeting? Remember, the term of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan runs out March 2, only eight months before the presidential election.On Jan. 31, the Fed ignored the warning signal from the 8% rise in the price of gold above the 1995 average. The Fed effectively said that even though there is some move out of dollars into gold, it will declare inflation to be satisfactory and give another small shove toward growth. Since the discount rate announcement, the price of gold has risen $11, to $415 an ounce; 30-year bonds have fallen two points in price, taking the yield up to 6.17% despite economic data that ought to have been favorable for bonds; and the dollar has fallen two yen, to 105 yen. Why was the immediate response to this monetary policy change so adverse?1. The rise in the price of gold was ignored by the Fed. Standing pat or doing nothing could have achieved a great deal. The Fed could have demonstrated its concern by leaving the funds rate unchanged at 5.5%. If the Fed had not ignored the signal, the suspicions that led to a preference for gold probably would have abated.",1,0.3214,0.6786,3542

1554,"The Dismal Science: The Best Way to Give Business a Boost. Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending.The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils: losses in the time value of money (a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised) and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages.",1,0.0,1.0,3562

The breaking-off of budget negotiations between President Reagan and congressional leaders yesterday leaves the nation facing a string of huge budget deficits and continuing high interest rates, with little chance for a sustained economic recovery anytime soon.Congress still could find some way to reduce the deficits. But, in the absence of major spending cuts and tax increases, interest rates are likely to stay so high that the important, housing and auto industries almost certainly will remain deeply depressed, according to a number of economists. The high rates also probably will lead businesses to keep cutting back their capital investment plans, the key to healthy, longterm economic growth.Murray L. Weidenbaum, ReaganUas chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the presidentUas February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down.

1557,"Fed Felt Hamstrung By 2005 Housing Bubble. Author: Sudeep ReddyWASHINGTON--Federal Reserve officials acknowledged a housing-market bubble more than a year before U.S. house prices peaked, but they showed little inclination to address it, according to transcripts of their 2005 meetings released Friday.During 2005, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter-percentage point at every meeting, unwinding the ultra-loose policy it pursued earlier in the decade to address deflation worries after the 2001 recession. The economy at the time was growing at a healthy pace with few signs of overheating. But with reports across the U.S. indicating a bubble in the housing market, the Federal Open Market Committee spent time assessing the appreciation in home prices and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it. Fed staff economists had found that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20%, based on the historical relationship between prices and rents.But Fed officials appeared hamstrung because they believed their most important tool--interest rates--could not address frothy housing markets alone without influencing the broader economy.""I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble,"" said Fed Governor Edward Gramlich, who died in 2007.

But, right now, the market sees no such upset for Brilliant Ben and the Fantastic Federal Reserve, as they continue their rescue of the U.S. economy.Mr. Bernanke's extraordinary policies have undeniably succeeded in persuading investors to plow their cash hoard into riskier assets. The S&P 500 has leapt a staggering 43% in a year. Junk bonds currently yield 5.85 percentage points more than adjusted Treasury yields, according to Bank of America. That's far tighter than the 9.61 percentage points seen nine months after the 2001 recession.Indeed, only 18 months after debt markets shut down completely, companies now seem to believe that they will be open indefinitely. For instance, Fitch Ratings recently noted that corporate borrowers have started to wait to renegotiate expiring credit facilities, believing they'll get better terms in the future.The bull thesis is seductive. The easy money is creating self-sustaining growth in the real economy that will in turn provide the earnings needed to keep stock and bond prices rallying.

Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers.

WASHINGTON -- The February decline in the unemployment rate masks continuing problems among the nation's manufacturers.The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 7.3% of the work force last month from 7.4% in January, the Labor Department said. But it took a large rise in services employment to offset substantial declines in manufacturing and construction employment, according to the department's survey of business payrolls. The average hours of factory workers also dropped, to 40.0 a week from 40.6. Together, the numbers suggest industrial production actually fell in the month.Analysts believe some of the decline in manufacturing and construction may have been tied to harsh weather during February. But the numbers also seem to suggest that manufacturers have yet to fully recover from the sluggish growth that occurred in last year's third quarter.""The decline in manufacturing reflects the overbuilding of inventories in late 1984 and increased import penetration as a result of the rapid escalation of the dollar,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.Companies should be able to work off excess inventories in the next month or two.

NEW YORK -- Bond prices were little changed in subdued trading yesterday as investors braced for the government's latest report this morning on employment.The employment data for January are likely to prompt the Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates higher in an attempt to cool the fast-growing economy, many analysts and investors say. The report is expected to show that non-farm employment grew a strong 292,000, while the civilian unemployment rate held steady at 5.3% last month, according to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.If employment growth is as robust as economists expect, it would put pressure on the Federal Open Market Committee to tighten monetary policy when the Fed policy-making body meets Tuesday and Wednesday, analysts said.The report is likely to lead to a ""volatile and erratic day,"" of trading, said Robert Falconer, a senior vice president in bond trading at CRT Government Securites Ltd. here.

1579,"30-Year Mortgage Rates Dip Below 6%. Rates on 30-year mortgages fell below the 6 percent level this week for the first time in three months, but economists said they don't expect rates to stay that low for long.Freddie Mac said Thursday in its weekly nationwide survey that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 5.98 percent this week, down from 6 percent last week. The rate was the lowest since late April, when 30-year rates averaged 5.94 percent.Since peaking at a high for this year of 6.34 percent in mid- May, 30-year mortgage rates have been headed lower, reflecting in part a slowdown in economic activity in June.The economy hit what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday termed a ""soft patch"" in June. Greenspan, however, in delivering the Fed's mid-year economic forecast to Congress, sought to allay fears that the slowdown could threaten the sustainability of the recovery. He predicted that growth would soon rebound even as the Fed proceeds with what Greenspan indicated should be a gradual pace of rate increases.Frank Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that the Fed's outlook for the second half of this year was ""more upbeat than expected,"" and he said this stronger growth will translate into further increases in mortgage rates and other interest rates set by financial markets along with the rise in short-term rates controlled by the Fed. ""However, the rise in mortgage rates will be measured, not extreme, and that will help keep the housing industry stable and affordable in the coming months,"" he said.",1,0.3496,0.6504,3732
1580,"It's Time to Take Some Profits. Author: Dave KansasThe stock market has had a heady few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has mustered above 11000 for the first time since April -- and it has managed to stay there through the early part of the third-quarter earnings season.But the swift rise of the market -- the Dow is up about 10% from its Aug. 31 close -- comes against a backdrop of somewhat unsettling news. The jobless rate remains stuck just below 10% with little respite in sight. The housing market is still very weak, and is enduring further shocks as lenders' foreclosure problems keep getting worse. The political situation seems a bit chaotic. And the global recovery is uneven enough that the Federal Reserve is thinking of yet more extraordinary measures to get things rolling.Even with those headwinds, the mood among stock investors as we near the end of October is surprisingly upbeat. Third-quarter earnings are coming in better than expected and optimism about the Fed's latest extraordinary plan -- quantitative easing part two, or QE2 -- is rampant in the stock market. We entered the dreaded September-October period in fear; we are leaving it with bliss breaking out.Such sudden shifts in sentiment, especially with uncertainty on the rise, makes me a little queasy. Given the widespread gains, it might make sense to examine your portfolio now with an eye toward rebalancing, rather than wait for the end of the year.

The nation's jobless rate dropped slightly to 6.4 percent in December, and the number of jobs nationwide increased modestly--news that the financial markets and economists viewed as reassuring signs that economic growth would be steady but not strong enough to revive inflation.The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since early 1991, down from 6.5 percent in November, the government reported yesterday. The November number, however, was revised upward from 6.4 percent initially reported a month ago. The adjustment was made to reflect seasonal variations.The reports from the Labor Department were read as good news, partly because the prospect of moderate growth helped ease fears that the Federal Reserve Board would increase short-term interest rates to control inflation.""The economy is on track for steady economic growth in 1994,"" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

For the past few years, investors could probably have made more money by picking up loose change from the sidewalk than by investing in a money-market mutual fund.Money funds are likely to regain appeal once interest rates rise again. Historically, when rates start moving upward, money-fund yields quickly follow, unlike those of bank savings accounts, which can lag.But for now, persistently low rates--coupled with uncertainty about a possible regulatory overhaul for money funds--are reasons to avoid using the funds for all but very-short-term parking of cash, financial advisers say.Money funds are mutual funds that invest in very-short-term debt issued by governments and large corporations, and that strive to maintain a set $1 share price. The average yield on taxable money funds for individual investors is just 0.01% a year, according to Crane Data LLC of Westborough, Mass.

WASHINGTON -- Retail sales jumped a surprising 1.4% in February, the Commerce Department said.The big increase suggests consumer spending continues to be strong in spite of signs of weakness among the nation's manufacturing industries. Manufacturing employment declined last month, and many analysts believe that February industrial-production figures, to be reported tomorrow, will also show a decline.This combination of strong demand and weak production suggests to many analysts that foreign manufacturers are taking a rapidly growing share of the U.S. market as this country's trade deficit widens.""Thanks to the strong dollar, imports are clearly gaining market share,"" said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

1585,"The Great Terror; A massive new history of Hitler's tyranny.. Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence.",1,0.33330000000000004,0.6667,3763

The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come.

The lower exports helped drive the United States' trade deficit for that month to a record $12 billion.The downturn in sales of American goods to Asia, which economists have anticipated ever since the region's financial markets collapsed last fall, has manifested itself up to now mainly in anecdotes about individual U.S. firms losing business.But with yesterday's report ""it's undeniable that the effect of the crisis is in the data,"" said David Hensley, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York.Hensley cited exports to South Korea, which plunged to $1.096 billion in January from $1.680 billion the previous month.

The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic.

NEW YORK -- The long-anticipated rally in cyclical stocks arrived last week in a rip-roaring market advance that lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.9% to a record 3027.50.Money managers, returned from their Memorial Day weekend, began sorting through scraps of economic news and spotted a pattern suggesting the recession was ending, or about to. Not wanting to be caught arriving late to a rally, the money managers quickly bid up shares of companies whose fortunes are tied to the economic cycle.On Friday, cyclical stocks led the Dow Jones industrials to a record. Caterpillar gained 2 5/8 to 51 3/4; International Paper rose 2 to 70 5/8; and United Technologies rose 2 1/2 to 46 7/8. Together, these three stocks accounted for almost half of the average's 27-point gain. Meanwhile, big noncyclical growth stocks slumped: Merck fell 1 5/8 and McDonald's dropped 1/4 to 35.But even as cyclical issues race ahead, many growth stock investors are standing pat on their portfolios. Cyclicals could well outperform growth stocks for the next several weeks, these investors say. But in the longer-term -- for the next year or two -- stocks of companies that grow earnings steadily 15% or better each year could maintain their leadership.

Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars.Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests.Third, both parties in Congress already are showing in real life why such plans are at risk.

Demand for manufactured goods fell sharply in August as new- home sales slid to their lowest monthly level in 17 years. And in the week ended Sept. 20, new unemployment filings hit the highest level since just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.U.S. leaders hope the government's massive interventions, plus plans for a big bailout now being negotiated, will soften the blow.

1633,"Behind the Middle-Class Funk. President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable livesConcern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did.",1,0.3694,0.6306,4011
1634,"Has the Bull Just Been Sleeping?. Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end.

1639,"Fed Considers More Action Amid New Recovery Doubts. Disappointing U.S. economic data, new strains in financial markets and deepening worries about Europe's fiscal crisis have prompted a shift at the Federal Reserve, putting back on the table the possibility of action to spur the recovery.Such action seemed highly unlikely at the central bank's April meeting, when forecasts for growth and employment were brightening. At their policy meeting this month, Fed officials will weigh whether the U.S. economic outlook is deteriorating enough to justify new measures to boost growth, according to interviews and Fed speeches.The Fed's next meeting, June 19 and 20, could be too soon for conclusive decisions. Fed policy makers have many unanswered questions and have had trouble forming consensus in the past. Top Fed officials have said that they would support new measures if they became convinced the U.S. wasn't making progress on bringing down unemployment. Recent disappointing employment reports have raised this possibility, but the data might be a temporary blip. Moreover, the Fed's options for more easing are sure to stir internal resistance at the central bank if they are considered.Their options include doing nothing and continuing to assess the economic outlook--or more strongly signaling a willingness to act later if the outlook more clearly worsens. Fed policy makers could take a small precautionary measure, like extending for a short period its ""Operation Twist"" program, in which the Fed is selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities. Or, policy makers could take bolder action such as launching another large round of bond purchases if they become convinced of a significant slowdown.The landscape for the Fed is complicated by the presidential election. Mindful of his own legacy and the Fed's independence, Chairman Ben Bernanke seems unlikely to allow the political calendar to sway his decisions. He appears especially immune from politics now, with just 18 months left in his term as chairman and little indication that he wants another.

Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France.",1,0.0,1.0,4094

Less than six months into his term, Mr. Obama's top initiatives -- health-care reform and ""cap and trade"" energy legislation -- are in serious jeopardy and he has himself and his congressional allies to blame.Their high-pressure tactics in promoting and passing legislation, most notably the economic ""stimulus"" enacted in February, have backfired. Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933. Like FDR, Mr. Obama tried to push as many liberal bills through Congress in as brief a time as possible.He made a rookie mistake early on. He let congressional Democrats draft the bills.

They own the stimulus outright.That makes them accountable for the hopes of a prompt economic recovery now being dashed.

Weaker than expected retail sales figures for May blew the scent of recession back into the bond market yesterday, a worry that sparked one of the bigger one-day rallies of the past year.The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly 2 1/4 points to 114 1/32, or about $22.50 for every $1,000 bond. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.54%.Movement in the Treasury's two year note was even more dramatic. Its price which is roughly six times more sensitive to movements than the 30-year bond, rose nearly 5/8 of a point, while its yield fell 31 hundredths of a percentage point to 5.61%, its biggest one-day move in five years.Traders, investors and economists said the weak retail sales figures for May -- a 0.2% gain compared with expectations of 0.6% -- confirmed suspicions about the economy's weakness.

1647,"The Case for A Recession. Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually.",1,0.371,0.629,4115

Alan Murray's Dec. 3 column ""Political Calculus: Bush Now Embraces a Stimulus Package"" suggests that the administration's economic-stimulus plan is largely politically motivated and would have only a moderate short-term economic impact. Isn't it a little early to start criticizing a plan that is still being developed?Though we are encouraged by some recent signs of a rebound, the economy is recovering at half the rate of past recessions. A carefully crafted consumer, investor and business tax package would provide the synergies needed to push the economy into high gear and help ensure durable economic growth. In a recent letter to the president, we suggested cutting consumer taxes, allowing larger depreciation write-offs and reducing the double taxation of dividends.Our studies show that allowing companies to deduct 50% of corporate dividends would add one-half a percentage point to average GDP growth through 2005. Similarly, our study shows that this change would accelerate productivity growth to 2.4% over the next three years, compared with 2% without this change. A phased reduction of the double tax on corporate dividends would encourage firms to rely more on equity financing, leading to higher investment spending and a larger capital stock.One of the most effective ways to spur business investment and continued technological advances that promote productivity growth is through an enhanced capital-cost recovery system. Finally, accelerating the tax cuts enacted in June 2001 will help ensure that consumer confidence and spending remain strong. Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual rate, they also will benefit from accelerated rate cuts.Jerry Jasinowski",1,0.31299999999999994,0.687,4161

1658,"The Elder Share. ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs. For recipients with incomes above, say, $40,000 a year, entitlements (including Social Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare) would be progressively reduced, though never wiped out entirely.",1,0.3337,0.6663,4182

The Philadelphia Fed also uncovered evidence that factory wages are rising as a result of worker shortages.And a separate Fed report said the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.9% of capacity in May, higher than at any time since March 1980. Economists say that the closer business gets to operating at full capacity, the greater the risks of a spurt in inflation.Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.5% in April, largely reflecting a jump in wholesalers' inventories. Sales by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers dropped 0.2%. As a result, the ratio of inventories-to-sales increased slightly to 1.51 in April from 1.50 in March, remaining within the range in which the ratio has traveled for the past year.As the factory problems noted by the Fed may be interpreted by some as a sign of an overheating economy and more inflation, they could lead the central bank to boost interest rates in the coming months.

He also would raise taxes on gasoline, beer, wine, cigarettes and industrial pollutants, and would cut military spending by 3% from current levels. The goal of his five-year, $511.6 billion plan is to eliminate the projected budget deficit by the end of fiscal 1994 and create surpluses each year thereafter.But the Rostenkowski plan, or even anything close to it, isn't likely to be enacted this year as long as President Bush opposes major tax increases and cuts in Social Security.

Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. ItUas asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isnUat surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.They arenUat all wrong. Food prices went up 4 percent last year, and this yearUas increase is expected to be about the same. Our food prices are generally lower than those in other countries.

1693,"With Rates Low, It Makes Sense To Refinance Now, Pocket Savings. Q Now that interest rates are quite low, we have been exploring the idea of refinancing our 7.5 percent mortgage. Are there costs associated with refinancing? Is there a formula that tells us whether refinancing makes sense?A In recent years, many homeowners have made refinancing almost an annual ritual. Interest rates, which are near an all-time low, have been steadily dropping, and consumers have taken advantage of these lower rates.There are some costs, though, just as there were when you obtained your original mortgage. The only differences between a purchase and a refinance are that there is no buyer or seller present at closing, and no real estate broker is involved.Your refinance lender, even if it is the same lender who holds your current loan, has to start from scratch. The lender must obtain current financial information about you, contract for an updated appraisal of the property and receive an updated title report. Just because everything was acceptable several years ago when you obtained your mortgage does not mean that everything is acceptable today.You should shop around. Contact several mortgage lenders and brokers to determine what interest rates you can obtain. Determine what the various rates will be for a fixed 30-year mortgage, and compare those rates with a fixed 15-year mortgage as well as with an adjustable-rate mortgage.",1,0.3441,0.6559,4381

The analysis, which was requested by several lawmakers studying Social Security's financial problems, suggests that the Bush plan is so effective in reducing benefit costs that backers could afford to ease up a little.Democrat John Kerry's camp wasted little time in attacking Mr. Bush over the CBO report, focusing on the big cost to the federal government of setting aside a portion of payroll taxes to set up the private investment accounts.

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is likely, in light of November's strong employment figures, to decide to raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting Dec. 14.Interviews with Fed governors and district presidents who make up the central bank's policy committee suggest that many of them believe higher interest rates are needed to cool down the economy and prevent an acceleration of inflation.The 463,000-job increase in payroll employment ""was far bigger than anyone thought it was going to be,"" said Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The latest numbers add to ""anecdotal information from our district that the economy continues to be robust,"" agrees Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins. ""There is some sign here that policy should continue to err on the side of containing inflation.""But the Fed is unlikely to take decisive action before the Dec. 14 meeting unless it is confronted with a steep decline in the dollar. That's because officials are reluctant to appear overly responsive to monthly employment figures. ""Taking one month's figures and reacting in a knee-jerk manner is inappropriate for policymakers,"" says Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Fed, expressing a view that was echoed by other Fed officials.The presidents of the 12 Fed district banks have been leading the charge this year for a tighter monetary policy.

Many traders who fueled the record 86-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday were relying on a report last week showing that civilian unemployment in August declined from 6.9 to 6.8 percent, economists said.However, economists said that a small drop in unemployment for one month does not make a trend and that other statistics suggest continued stagnation.The Labor Department yesterday reported that the increase in the producer price index followed a 0.4 percent decline in July and no change in June.In a separate report, the Commerce Department reported that the retail sales increase was the largest since a 0.9 percent rise in April.

Credit-ratings firms say they plan to delay issuing any credit-rating downgrades to the largest U.S. banks as a result of new financial regulation.Moody's Investors Service analysts on Thursday said that, under the overhaul bill passed by the Senate last month, the government still has some room to bail out the biggest banks, at least in the short term -- an option it will likely choose as long as the economy and markets are unsettled.""Consequently, we expect that the senior debt and deposit ratings of systemically important banks in the U.S. will continue to benefit from unusual levels of support,"" Moody's analysts wrote in a report, ""until the economic recovery is sustained, financial market health is restored, and the risks of attempting to unwind an interconnected institution are reduced.""Moody's didn't specify which banks it considers systemically important, but the short list likely includes Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P.

Treasury bonds rallied Wednesday, sending the benchmark 10-year note's yield to its lowest in more than a year, as the minutes for the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting reassured investors that the central bank would be in no rush to raise interest rates.The 10-year note's yield fell to 2.331%, the lowest closing level since June 2013. The previous low of 2014 was 2.334% made on Aug. 28. Yields fall as prices rise.Yields on shorter-dated notes dropped at a sharper pace after the minutes as they are directly affected by the Fed's official interest-rate outlook. Longer-dated bonds are more affected by inflation, which chips away at investors' fixed returns over time.The yield on the two-year note fell to 0.46%, the lowest closing since Aug 19. The yield has tumbled after last month rising to near 0.6%, the highest level since 2011.Wednesday's price rally is the latest chapter in a yearlong flight to safe assets that underscores anxiety over the global economic outlook.

Baker III has been pursuing for the past six months. Baker has been skillfully buying time, waiting for the expected improvement in the trade and budget deficits to blunt protectionist pressures at home.The sense of the deficits turning around was also supposed to encourage Japan and West Germany to take increasingly larger steps to lead international growth and help out the U.S. economy.Baker had relied heavily on the CBO's original prediction that the deficit would come down to $161 billion by 1989.

1750,"How the Recovery Went Wrong; Of the 11 recoveries in the last 60 years, this one is at or near the bottom in job growth and every other economic indicator.. President Obama, in speech after speech, proudly makes the following point: Although we inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, we have generated net new jobs every month, and while we need to do more, we are going in the right direction.Of course, recoveries always go in the right direction--that is, things get better over time. But merely going in the right direction is an incredibly low performance standard. Moreover, since deep recessions are generally followed by more robust recoveries, this should have been one of the strongest recoveries ever.So what went wrong? All the available Keynesian levers for achieving economic growth have been pulled, yet the recovery is one of the weakest since World War II. The problem lies with the way the ""stimulus"" was carried out, the uncertainty of looming higher taxes, and the antibusiness rhetoric and regulatory strong-arming of this administration.First, exactly how weak has this recovery been? The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis tracks economic performance for each recovery and compares gross-domestic-product growth and job growth, the two most important indicators of economic performance. Over the past 60 years, there have been 11 recessions and 11 recoveries.Sadly, this recovery is near the bottom of all 11. Cumulative nonfarm job growth is just 1.9% 34 months into recovery, the ninth-worst performance and well below the average job growth of 6.5%. Cumulative GDP growth is just 6.8% 11 quarters into this recovery, less than half the average (15.2%) and the worst of all 11.",1,0.0,1.0,4732

1752,"U.S. Industrial Output Jumped 0.9% In April Despite Higher Interest Rates. WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. factories, mines and utilities continued to accelerate in April, offering further evidence of the economy's strength in the face of rising interest rates.Industrial output jumped 0.9% last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1% higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7%, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3% increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly.With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4% to 82.1%, the first time that the index has climbed above 82% in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84%, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecksThe report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years.Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6% run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7% in April, and is up an eye-popping 59% year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6% after being flat the last two months.",1,0.0,1.0,4747

Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.Consumer spending is ""strengthening sharply in the first quarter"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is ""recovering after the post-hurricane lull"" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says.",1,0.3548,0.6452,4764

New-home sales fell for the fourth-straight month in August to the lowest level in a half year as the bursting of the housing bubble continues to plague the U.S. economy.Sales fell by 2.3% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 295,000, the Commerce Department said Monday. It was the weakest pace in six months and the seventh-worst month on records dating to 1963.The results, however, were in line with forecasts, and July's results were revised upward slightly to a rate of 302,000. Compared with a year earlier, when new-home sales hit a record-low pace of 278,000, new-home sales were up 6.1%.August was an especially weak month for the new-homes market for several reasons. Turmoil in financial markets after Standard & Poor's unprecedented downgrade of U.S. debt, fears of a renewed recession and Hurricane Irene all combined to keep buyers away.Given all those negative factors, ""we are moderately relieved at this number,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

1795,"Stock Gyrations Won't Damage Economy --- Experts Say Sharper Drops Are Needed to Cause Tailspin. The lurching stock market may make consumers queasy, but it's going to take more than that to make them sick enough to trigger an economic downturn.Think back to 1987. Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, ""only at some future point"" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R. French, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. Still, a continued stock price plunge in that sector, he said, might reduce its access to venture capital and inhibit initial public offerings.In general, however, the wider economy is largely insulated from the stock market's volatility. True, more ""little guys"" have their money in the stock market today. According Federal Reserve numbers cited by James Poterba, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 38.4% of all U.S.households held some kind of stock in 1992, the latest year for which data are available, up from 33.2% in 1983.

Depending upon what figures we read, unemployment went up or it went down in the District of Columbia in January, according to a city government report. The jobless rate for city residents was 9.2 percent.The report revised some previous figures, and showed that the District, was worse off in December than the national average, rather than better off, as previously announced figures had indicated. The District also was worse off in January.To take it from the top: The D.C. Employment Services Department announced a month ago that the jobless rate for December was 8.6 percent. Yesterday it said that figure was wrong, that a statistical recalculation based on new national survey techniques showed the December rate really was 9.4 percent.Using that figure, JanuaryUas 9.2 rate as adjusted was somewhow really lower than the 8.6 percent for the previous month.The new figures show that the DistrictUas 9.4 percent figure for December was higher than the national average rate of 8.8 percent and the 9.2 percent figure for January was higher than the U.S. average rate of 8.9 percent.

The bond vigilantes are acting a lot less vigilant these days.There was a time, following the inflation crisis of the early 1980s, when the bond market, regardless of the Federal Reserve's policy, worked to keep a lid on bond prices just to be sure the economy didn't get too steamy. Whenever there were signs that the pace of growth was picking up, the so-called vigilantes would rush to sell, driving interest rates higher and acting as a brake on the economy.But if last week was any indication, a new era may be upon us.The market is soaring. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond plummeted to 6.37% from 6.69% in just the past six trading days. Behind it all is a conviction among bond investors and traders that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates until inflation actually shows signs of picking up, and recent figures demonstrate that isn't happening, and probably won't, for at least a while.Overall, of course, that's good for bonds.

WASHINGTON -- Though a sharp jump in wholesale prices in September set off fears on Wall Street that long-dormant inflation has awakened, economists said the numbers were artificially boosted by a number of one-time factors, and that widespread evidence of rising prices was still slight.Indeed, the report seems unlikely to spark much panic in one place it matters most, the Federal Reserve, which is charged with keeping inflation in check. In comments over the past few weeks, top officials have been more likely to marvel about the tameness of prices than to express concern about nascent inflation.""The sticker shock . . . exaggerates the inflation numbers,"" economists at Warburg Dillon Reed LLC wrote Friday in a report to clients, adding that the price rises ""do not represent a significant change in the underlying trend of inflation."" The Fed, too, ""will be able to look past these developments,"" the Warburg analysts concluded. While the odds of a central-bank interest-rate increase next month may be rising, they said, ""they are not yet above 50% in our opinion.""The numbers in the Labor Department's producer-price report for September were, indeed, stunning. The index for finished goods soared by 1.1%, seasonally adjusted, the biggest monthly increase in nine years. That followed a large 0.5% jump in August, an especially terrible back-to-back performance for a price gauge that has been flat or negative for much of the past two years.
