The Dow industrials and S&P 500 clinched fresh all-time highs after the nominee to head the Federal Reserve defended the central bank's economic stimulus efforts, though weak earnings from Cisco Systems hurt technology stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 54.59 points, or 0.3%, to 15876.22, while the S&P 500 gained 8.62 points, or 0.5%, to 1790.62. Both indexes ended at record levels for a second consecutive day. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 7.16 points, or 0.2%, to 3972.74, its highest finish in more than 13 years.Investors focused on Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, President Barack Obama's nominee to lead the central bank after Ben Bernanke steps down in January, for signals about Fed policy.Ms. Yellen said in a hearing on her nomination before the Senate Banking Committee that there are dangers to ending the central bank's $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program too soon, an assurance to investors that few big policy changes are on the way. The Fed's bond-buying program is widely credited for helping to enable the S&P 500's 26% gain in 2013.""In her first test before the Senate she's come across clear and concise and saying what we expected,"" said Yousef Abbasi, New York-based market strategist at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services.",0,0.6838,0.31620000000000004,2836
1,"Transport Firms Hoist Away on Prices Strong Economy Leads to First Increases in a Decade. Transportation companies are jacking up prices for the first time in a decade as the strong economy is filling trucks, ships and trains with more goods than they can handle.Shipping companies have notified corporate customers that freight -- moving charges this year -- which total about $450 billion annually -- will rise between 5% and 10% for some cargoes.Costs for package-hauling are also creeping upward. The U.S. Postal Service hopes to raise rates on its Priority Mail expedited service this year to $3.20 for a letter from $3.00, twice as big an increase as its last price boost in 1995. And giant United Parcel Service of America Inc. brought its commercial ground-transportation prices up 3.6% last month, partially to pay for its hefty new labor settlement with the Teamsters.Already, a wide range of shippers, from chemical concerns to farmers, are noticing the shift. The drugstore giant Walgreen Co. says trucking companies just told it about a planned 5% rate hike, no small sum for a company that spends about $100 million a year on trucking. ""You do your best in bargaining them down,"" says Tom Stedman, director of corporate transportation.The price increases are coming at a time when overall inflation in the U.S. has been tame. The consumer price index, the nation's broadest measure of consumer price inflation, rose just 1.7% in 1997. And with commodity prices falling and inexpensive imports flooding into the country because of Asia's currency crisis, few economists believe rising transportation costs are enough to re-ignite inflation. But if those deflationary extras disappear, economists see cause for concern. At the very least, they say, corporate profits could suffer.",0,0.6842,0.3158,4363

3,"CBO Sees Little Gain in Cutting Mortgage Interest Deduction. Limiting interest deductions to the first $300,000 of home mortgages would affect fewer than 1 million families and do little to cut the federal deficit, congressional analysts said.A proposal to cut the maximum deductible mortgage, now at $1 million, is one of several options being weighed by the Clinton administration. Another would limit a couple to t a $20,000 annual interest deduction and a single person to $12,000.But neither would make a significant dent in the $300 billion-a-year budget deficit. The $300,000 limitation would cut the red ink by about $2.5 billion, the Congressional Budget Office said. The $12,000-$20,000 ceiling would save about $4 billion.The $300,000 ceiling would be especially harmful in high-cost areas, the home-building industry said. ""Half the new revenue would come from California,'' said David Crowe of the National Association of Home Builders.Outright repeal of the mortgage deduction would reduce the deficit by about $43 billionUOin theory.

5,"Airport Woes and Trust Fund's 'Surpluses'. There is a deepening suspicion among air travelers that the delays and frustrations they are experiencing at busy airports are the result of a conspiracy -- a conspiracy hatched in Washington. Rumors abound that the government is diverting funds earmarked for better aviation to reduce the deficit. That the Federal Airport and Airways Trust Fund has an uncommitted balance of $5.6 billion is often cited as proof that something fishy is going on.In truth, however, this uncommitted balance, or ""surplus,"" is not a surplus at all. It is an optical illusion created by focusing on the trust fund and not on total spending for federal aviation.The trust fund was created to finance capital improvements at the nation's airports, to modernize the computers, radars and other equipment used by air traffic controllers, and to defray part of the costs of operating and maintaining the air traffic control system. It also was designed so that those who enjoy the benefits of modern air travel would be the ones to pay, rather than the general taxpayer. Accordingly, the fund's revenues come from an 8% tax on airline tickets, taxes on aviation fuels, and interest earned on cash in the fund.Understandably, aviation users, who have steadily been paying taxes into the trust fund, would like to know why it has a large and growing uncommitted balance. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not because the administration has been hoarding the money in an attempt to reduce the federal deficit. In fact, fiscal 1987 aviation user taxes of $3.2 billion were less than estimated spending of $5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, thereby increasing the federal deficit by $1.8 billion. The trust-fund balance has grown because Congress has forced the government to use general fund revenues -- including personal income taxes -- to pay for aviation programs, instead of allowing money to be spent out of the trust as intended.Congress created this situation by putting ""penalty provisions"" into the 1982 law that authorized the trust fund. First, Congress limited the amount of money that could be paid out of the trust fund to a percentage of funding for airport improvement. Thus, only about 71% of FAA costs could be paid for out of the trust fund, even though several studies have shown that those paying into the fund account for about 85% of that agency's costs. Then, Congress reduced that even further by tying trust-fund spending for operational costs, such as air traffic controllers, to the amount of money spent each year for capital-improvement programs, such as replacing outdated computers.",0,1.0,0.0,364
6,"3.5% Pay Raise for Federal Workers Gains Momentum With Senate Panel's Approval. Last week, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee approved the raise as part of a $90.6 billion spending bill for the Transportation and Treasury departments and several small agencies. The pay raise was approved by the House Appropriations Committee in July.The decision by the Senate subcommittee should make it relatively easy for the House and Senate to include the raise in legislation that can be sent to the president. But House and Senate aides expect that it might be weeks before Congress wraps up spending bills for fiscal 2005, raising the prospect that House-Senate agreement on the pay raise might not be reached until after Election Day.President Bush proposed a 1.5 percent pay raise for the civil service and a 3.5 percent raise for the military in his fiscal 2005 budget. But several members of the Washington area delegation organized support for a ""pay parity"" approach to provide the government's civilian employees with a raise equal to that of the military.Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who often plays a key role in the annual pay-setting process, has repeatedly noted that Congress has provided equal pay adjustments to civil service and military employees in 17 of the past 20 years.During this year's debate, Hoyer and other Washington area lawmakers stressed that civil service employees have taken on expanded responsibilities for homeland security and the war against terrorism.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004,335
7,"Mutual Funds May Shift Prices To Fix Glitch. Some mutual-fund companies may make changes to year-end fund prices after a trading glitch caused several companies to publish inaccurate data in recent days.Yesterday, the Nasdaq Stock Market, which provides the price listings used by newspapers for more than 10,000 mutual funds, sent a memo to U.S. mutual-fund companies asking them to make any necessary changes to their year-end prices. The move came after a number of fund companies, including giant Fidelity Investments, experienced problems publishing accurate share prices for funds that held the stock of America Online Inc., which experienced year-end price swings on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the last trading day of 1998. The swings caused confusion among mutual funds over the closing price for AOL that day.The problems affected several wellknown funds, including Fidelity's Magellan Fund. In pricing shares of funds that held stock of the Internet company, several fund outfits initially used an incorrect, lower closing price for AOL when distributing per-share fund data to outlets for publication in newspapers and other uses.As a result, the price that mutual-fund buyers were charged to purchase funds that held AOL stock was actually higher than the too-low price that appeared in their newspaper fund listings.In a memo to fund companies, Nasdaq called on fund groups that may have a problem to ""correct the closing"" net-asset value of funds for 1998. The problem, Nasdaq officials say, is that end-of-year information is important in determining mutual-fund rankings and even tax issues that affect small investors.",0,1.0,0.0,4145

The three patented chips use WCDMA technology, a small but fast-growing part of the wireless market used mostly in American T-Mobile and AT&T phones.Selna ruled that Qualcomm can continue to sell other disputed chips in the United States until January 2009, but must pay royalties on those chips, which use a different technology and are used on Verizon and Sprint networks.

Major banks cut their prime lending rates by one-quarter of a point to 8V2 percent yesterday, reflecting a recent decline in interest rates caused by expectations of a slowdown in the economy.The reduction in the benchmark rate will trim borrowing costs for many corporate and individual borrowers, furnishing a bit of a stimulus to an economy that is certain to turn sluggish in coming months, economists said.Reagan administration officials welcomed the banksUa move, which came amid growing worries that the economyUas growth during the election campaign will be so anemic that Republican candidates will be hurt.The banksUa action was prompted by a decline in the rates that the banks themselves pay on borrowed funds and on deposits. Those rates have been dropping because of the widespread expectation that an economic slowdown would diminish demand for loans by businesses and consumers. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is thought to be on the verge of easing credit conditions slightly, which is also helping to lower rates.A fresh harbinger of a slowdown in the economy emerged yesterday when the Commerce Department reported that its composite index of leading indicators decreased in December for the third month in a row.",0,1.0,0.0,1838

WASHINGTON -- Culminating more than a year of effort by the U.S., Britain and scores of antipoverty activists, the governors of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund endorsed a plan to forgive as much as $55 billion in loans to as many as 40 impoverished nations.The endorsements, during a series of weekend meetings here, make the debt-relief offer all but final.

The best that can be said for China's weekend decision to drop its dollar peg and again adopt more ""exchange-rate flexibility"" is that it may avert a trade war. What no one should believe is that China's move will ""rebalance"" the world economy or send manufacturing jobs rushing back to America.The People's Bank of China asserted that its decision was made in China's own economic interests, and no doubt that's true. But its timing a week before the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto is no coincidence, comrade. China did not want its exchange rate to become the conclave's focus, diverting attention from the failures of U.S. and European economic policies.Senator Chuck Schumer and other U.S. protectionists have also been promising a new tariff against Chinese goods if Beijing didn't move on the exchange rate. And this time the New York Democrat seemed to have corralled such key party colleagues as Max Baucus, chairman of Senate Finance, and Sander Levin of House Ways and Means as his Smoot and Hawley.Given the Democratic panic about their November election prospects and President Obama's ebbing political authority, a protectionist mistake from the U.S. Congress cannot be ruled out. China's move reduces the odds of such a blunder, at least in the short run, and that should help the fragile world recovery.We say ""short run"" because China's decision won't end the global demands for a revalued yuan.

20,"Stock Market Needs Anti-Dumping Rules. The recent announcement by New York Life Insurance Co. that it is liquidating its entire $1 billion stock portfolio because of its dissatisfaction with the market's volatility furnishes dramatic evidence that the flight of the investor from the securities market continues unabated. Now, not only the small investor but also some larger institutions are exiting a stock market in which sharp fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often unaccompanied by any significant external news or event, recur with predictable frequency.The pattern of these fluctuations is particularly revealing. Often, trading will remain flat throughout the day, only for prices to dive suddenly at the close in the face of heavy institutional trading. Admittedly, one cannot legislate a secure investment environment, but investors are unlikely to return to the market until they see it as a relatively stable repository for their funds. A market that can move 20-30 points in a few minutes, because of sudden selling pressure, will not be so perceived.Yet, wasn't it exactly this problem that the proposals of the Brady Commission and other recent reports were supposed to address? The short answer is no. The recommendations advanced by both Brady and the SEC understandably focused on a worse-case scenario: how to avoid a financial meltdown. As a result, short of a catastrophic event, their proposed reforms will have little impact and could even be counterproductive.Consider, for example, the two most discussed Brady proposals: (1) the circuit-breaker reforms, and (2) the recommendation that margin rules be effectively equalized between the securities and futures exchanges. Will it create confidence among small investors to know that in the future a brief inter-market trading halt will occur once the stock market declines 250 points or more? Such a proposal is as reassuring as a contingency plan for urban survival after a nuclear holocaust.More important, circuit breakers create an incentive to sell as their triggering point is neared; thus, they can exacerbate matters by encouraging a ""run on the bank"" as investors sell because they suspect others will also do so as the trigger point is neared. If trading halts are to reduce volatility, they will have to be introduced at a much earlier point and seek to bridge temporary order imbalances. Although probably feasible, such a proposal risks the danger that any halt will be interpreted as an adverse signal that triggers still more selling.",0,1.0,0.0,3322

24,"U.S. News --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Santorum Grasps Key Realities for Republicans. Republicans already obsessing about the 2016 presidential sweepstakes have paid little attention so far to Rick Santorum. That's a mistake.A mistake not because Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator and unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate, is likely to win his party's nomination. He's a long shot if he runs again.It is a mistake because Mr. Santorum has written a new book, ""Blue Collar Conservatives,"" that shows he grasps two important realities that seem to escape many others. The first is that, outmoded stereotypes notwithstanding, blue-collar Americans, particularly working-class whites in the South and Midwest, today comprise a core element of the Republican Party. The second reality is that, because of the alienation these people feel from both the political and economic systems, the table is set for a new period of populism.That helps explain why longtime private-equity executive Mitt Romney, though an accomplished and experienced figure, wasn't the ideal standard-bearer for the party in 2012, Mr. Santorum argues. More important, he says, these realities suggest Republicans need to rethink their policy focus going forward.""We Republicans have neglected to focus our policies and our rhetoric on the plight of lower-income Americans,"" he writes. Later, he adds: ""Our focus on tax cuts for individuals not only leaves us open to the 'tax breaks for the rich' sloganeering of the Left but seems irrelevant to the nearly 50% of the population who don't pay federal income taxes today.""",0,1.0,0.0,122

NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Board has imposed further tough restrictions on the operations of limited-service banks, a move that some bankers say will make these new banks unattractive to set up.The restrictions, which are set out in a letter to Suburban Bancorp, Bethesda, Md., go beyond those publicly announced by the Fed, some bankers say. They prohibit a bank holding company from providing most banking services, such as check clearing, data processing and check cashing, for a limited-service banking office.The new limitations also put the Fed increasingly at odds with the Comptroller of the Currency, which already has approved applications for dozens of limited service banks.Limited-service banks, because they either don't make commercial loans or don't take demand deposits, fall outside the legal definition of a bank. Creation of large numbers of limited-service banks around the country would transform the banking industry, since they provide a way around the prohibition on interstate banking and bank ownership by non-banking businesses.The latest restrictions strike most noticeably at bank holding companies, which are eager to set up limited-service banking operations beyond their home states.

Indonesia's attempt to sell bonds to local investors fell flat Monday, stymieing the government's effort to reduce the volatility of its currency.The Ministry of Finance had been looking to raise $450 million through its first-ever offering of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars to local investors. But weak demand for the bonds, with a coupon rate of 3.5%, meant the government was only able to raise $190 million--less than half its target.The bond sale comes as investors around the globe are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting back on its massive stimulus effort. Indonesian markets have been among the hardest hit by expectations the Fed will soon pull back on its $85-billion-a-month bond-buying program, a move that is expected to send U.S. interest rates higher and make emerging markets less attractive. Countries with both a fiscal deficit and current-account deficit, like Indonesia, rely heavily on foreign investment and can see their currencies plunge if investors flee.The debt sale was part of an effort to stabilize Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, which has already fallen by more than 20% against the dollar this year. The sale of the bonds was designed to increase the pool of dollars in the country to help meet local demand for the U.S. currency. Having more dollars on hand can help lessen the currency shock when foreign investors depart.Already, Bank Indonesia has raised its benchmark interest rate by a percentage point since late August, to 7.5%. Higher interest rates tend to draw overseas investors, and the move was widely seen as an effort to shield the economy from the turbulence that is expected when the Fed winds down its easy-money program.",0,1.0,0.0,4102

Unemployment rates are rising steeply, annual inflation is forecast at 45 to 50 percent, and street crime and scattered acts of civil disobedience are mounting -- all related to the nation's current economic strife.Although Mexico's foreign creditors are being repaid on schedule -- thanks to a U.S.-organized bailout totaling $38 billion and a sharp reversal in the trade balance -- senior Mexican officials acknowledge that much of the recovery will come at the expense of average citizens.More than 500,000 people already have lost their jobs in the economic crisis sparked by the Dec. 20 devaluation of the Mexican peso, while the national chamber of small industries, known as Canacintra, warned this week that another 250,000 will join the ranks of the unemployed before year's end. One-fifth of all Mexicans are either unemployed or underemployed, according to another national employers' association, while Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas warned last month that 14 million of Mexico's 92 million people now live in poverty.One of the most worrisome aspects of the crisis, officials say, is that funds for severance pay for laid-off employees, normally totaling three months' salary, are beginning to run out.

48,"Welcome Back?. Federal officials are confident that the government can absorb 10,000 new workers from the welfare rolls without disrupting regular personnel operations and office routines or harming the quality of government work. Even members of Congress who often are skeptical of social engineering programs, especially in government, express little concern that this effort will do any harm.But some rank-and-file federal workers, not to mention ex-feds who were downsized into the unemployment ranks, are less than happy about the White House's welfare-to-work program.The program will hardly be noticeable in most federal agencies. The Census Bureau will take the largest number of the welfare-to-work hires (about 40 percent of the total hires), with the Defense Department hiring most of the rest.Most of the new hires will go into temporary jobs outside the regular civil service system. They will do basic office work and will be paid at Grade 1, or about $13,500 a year. Agencies also expect that they will have to provide low- or no-cost day care and transit subsidies.Career officials in several agencies say they have been instructed to be upbeat about the plan, which is supposed to prompt private industry to hire many thousands more from the welfare rolls. The idea is to get some people off welfare and pay them while they pick up basic office skills and develop work habits that could lead to full-time jobs in private industry. It is yet to be determined how many welfare recipients -- if any -- will be hired by officials who developed the program.",0,0.6663,0.3337,4770

New Year's Eve dawned with no solution to Washington's budget impasse, setting up a 24-hour scramble to determine whether lawmakers could do what they've promised for months: engineer an alternative to the so-called fiscal cliff.What happens Monday could go some way to determining the short-term fate of the U.S. economy and the reputation of the government, both of which have been dinged by the spectacle of endless seemingly circular negotiations.Carrying the baton late into Sunday evening were Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Vice President Joe Biden. A spokesman for Mr. McConnell said Monday morning that the two men ""will continue to work toward a solution."" In the past two weeks, at least three different sets of negotiation teams have sought a way out.On taxes, one of the thorniest issues on the table, the two sides appeared to be converging. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for raising individual income-tax rates on family income above $250,000. In the latest round of Senate talks, Republicans proposed a $550,000 threshold, which Democrats moved to $450,000, according to Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).On the estate tax, Democrats are no longer insisting on an increased rate and instead have agreed to put the matter to a separate vote, which suggests current rates will likely continue. That's a concession to the GOP and a number of farm-state Democrats in the Senate. Absent action, rates on estates will jump and the threshold at which they would hit is set to fall.",0,1.0,0.0,4718

China leapfrogged over Germany to become the world's third-largest economy in 2007, sooner than predicted, underscoring how quickly the concentration of global economic power has shifted.While earlier estimates had put growth of China's gross domestic product that year at 11.9 percent, revised figures released by the government statistics bureau Wednesday show that its economy actually expanded by 13 percent to $3.38 trillion. That compares with Germany's 2007 GDP of $3.32 trillion.Whether the growth trajectory will continue, however, has been complicated by the global recession, which has already prompted massive layoffs and waves of company closures, especially across southeastern China, the heartland of its export-driven economy. If China were to continue to grow at its current rate, economists say it could surpass Japan in as soon as three years and the United States in 18 years to become the world's No. 1 economy.In 2007, the United States remained the world's largest economy with a GDP of $13.8 trillion and Japan the second-largest with a $4.38 trillion GDP, according to calculations based on an annual average of daily exchange rates by Merrill Lynch.China is one of the few major economies that is on track to have positive GDP growth this year.

Did the subsequent days of roller-coaster markets make you even more confused? Many money managers claim to have the winning strategy. Of course, they disagree. Here are five who are staking big bucks on their predictions.David W. Tice, president of David W. Tice & Associates, manages the Prudent Bear mutual fund, started in 1995, and the Prudent Global Income Fund, launched in 2000. They have a combined $1 billion under management. The Bear fund aims to profit from a market downturn by betting that U.S. stocks will fall, a strategy known as ""shorting."" The Global fund is structured to benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar and rising gold prices.The recent downturn is proof that easy money has helped prolong a period of financial prosperity, says Tice, who thinks a stubborn bear market is likely settling in. Tice admits he has seen red in recent years; the Bear fund posted losses in 2003 and 2004 but has recorded modest returns since. He says he underestimated the willingness of mortgage lenders to do business with higher-risk borrowers. But as lenders begin to pay the price for those risky loans, Tice says he is bulking up on short positions on financial institutions, as well as other companies that depend on access to credit. ""We think this could be a 10- to 15-year decline,"" he said.David Poiesz, head of the growth-equity investment team at OppenheimerFunds, manages the $1.3 billion Oppenheimer Growth Fund and co-manages the $2.8 billion Oppenheimer Equity Fund.Some investors, he says, have too much money invested abroad after chasing higher returns in emerging markets.

The authors tell us that in measuring inequality, we should look to consumption rather than pretax cash income. This, allegedly, is because consumption ""will be set by consumers with an eye on their lifetime incomes.""Oh, really? How about single parents, pensioners or enlisted military personnel who resort to payday loans? Their consumption is set with an eye on their immediate, pressing needs, not their lifetime incomes.The authors seem to think that inequality can be measured by the quantity of washing machines or microwaves in poor homes. They don't consider debt levels. They seem unacquainted with foreclosures. They show no interest in future prospects.Most remarkable of all, the authors would undo the very basis of the equality, such as it is, that they perceive in America. The safety net?

63,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): A Trade Deficit Primer. As an April 30 deadline looms, the tom-toms of trade war are once again beating at George Bush to take a ""Super 301"" swipe at Japan, and maybe South Korea too. It's time to repeat that the conventional wisdom on trade deficits has it all exactly backward.The U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Japan because this country consumes too much and must therefore borrow to pay the bill. The trade deficit exists because Japan has to find somewhere to invest its huge pool of savings. The United States, which happens to be a very good place to invest, then buys Toyotas to recycle those savings back to Japan through the trade account. In other words, the trade deficit is a sign of American economic vigor, not weakness.We know this may sound startling, because the conventional wisdom has deemed that somehow there is a perfect trade ""balance,"" presumably at or close to zero. This logic ignores the central truth of foreign trade flows: There can't be a trade deficit without offsetting capital inflows. The trade deficit or surplus is merely an accounting identity.To refresh some memories on this point, it's worth reprinting the 1976 conclusions of the U.S. Advisory Committee on the Presentation of Balance of Payments Statistics. This was not a group of economic yahoos, but included Morgan Guaranty's Rimmer de Vries, Brookings's Walter Salant and Charles Schwartz of the International Monetary Fund. The committee said:""The words `surplus' and `deficit' should be avoided insofar as possible. . . . These words are frequently taken to mean that the developments are `good' or `bad' respectively. Since that interpretation is often incorrect, the terms may be widely misunderstood and used in lieu of analysis.""",0,1.0,0.0,3793

But when she toured the 106-foot vessel a few weeks ago, she spotted trouble: A framed photograph commemorating Japanese Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako's 1975 cruise with President Ford was accompanied by a brass plaque bearing the inscription: ""In 1945, President Harry Truman reportedly decided, while on the Sequoia, to drop the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.""Quinn immediately asked that the offending plaque be removed, and a new plaque -- omitting the reference to Hiroshima -- was ordered from a Capitol Hill framing shop. Yesterday, after dinner organizers got wind of our inquiries, the order for the new plaque was canceled; instead the whole display will be hidden away. Quinn told us: ""My initial reaction was that the whole point of entertaining people is to make them feel comfortable, and it seemed this would be a little insensitive to the guest of honor.""One problem resolved, another cropped up during last week's inspection by a Sony advance team: The onboard television set is a Sharp. We hear that the Sony folks demanded that it be replaced with one of their own models, but Sony Vice President Anne Murfogen told us she merely asked that the Sharp be stowed. ""Nobody will be watching TV,"" she said. We guess a screening of ""Pearl Harbor"" is out of the question.Stringer, meanwhile, told us: ""We're throwing a party for the chairman of Sony, who has rarely been in Washington, and we thought it was a great opportunity for him to meet politicians, business leaders and journalists -- that's all."" Among the invited guests, we hear, are Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of State Colin Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), AOL Time Warner chairman Steve Case and PBS anchor Jim Lehrer. ""I don't know anything about captions on pictures,"" Stringer said. ""That's not an issue with me or the Japanese executives.""",0,1.0,0.0,4879

71,"Schools Scramble to Make Grade Despite Lost Funding. Maryland educational leaders are bracing for the loss of about $190 million in projected state aid in the coming fiscal year after legislators decided to curtail additional funding.The impact at the local level varies widely, and officials are still assessing the damage to their budgets. But educators say they are working to ensure that the cuts do not affect the quality of instruction.Annual state education aid has increased by well over $1 billion since 2002 as a result of the Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act, better known as the Thornton plan for the commission that recommended it. But the plan never had a secured source of funding. With the state facing a $1.7 billion revenue shortfall, state lawmakers voted during a special session this month to eliminate inflation adjustments to the Thornton plan for 2009 and 2010 and limit the increases afterward.The cut will save the state about $190 million in 2009. By 2012, it is projected to save nearly $400 million. The savings may be partially offset by new revenue from the Geographic Cost of Education Index, a component of the Thornton plan that is to go into effect this year.Prince George's County, the hardest-hit system, stands to lose about $31.3 million, according to the fiscal analysis attached to the bill.

79,"Jonathan Yardley. Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls ""Big-time U,"" the ""large public university with high- profile football and/or men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels."" At many of these institutions, he argues, ""beer-and- circus--the party scene connected to big-time college sports events-- replaces meaningful undergraduate education."" The case he marshals against these places--""schools"" scarcely seems the right word--is overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of ""higher education"" in America.Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athletics--Sperber calls Florida State University the ""national champs"" of beer and circus, and with ample reason--but it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important.Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him (in a previous book, College Sports, Inc.) and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, ""just another number,"" rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load.Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities (and some of the private ones as well) are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators ""that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world."" A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni (and anyone else who would listen) that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News; that ambition seems to be universal.But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. ""In the 1980s,"" Sperber writes, ""some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.""",0,0.6639,0.33609999999999995,5004

WASHINGTON -- The House, responding to lobbying by technology companies, overwhelmingly approved a bill that would limit the required ""expensing"" of stock options.The bill overrides a proposal by a national accounting-standards panel that would have required companies to expense the value of all stock options. In their 312-111 vote, the lawmakers instead approved legislation to limit the expensing rule to options granted only to the top five officers of a company. The Financial Accounting Standards Board had proposed earlier this year that companies subtract the value of all employee stock compensation from company profits.The House vote gives the tech lobby, led by Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp., a significant victory over a weighty list of policy makers who argued against Congress intruding in standard-setting in the wake of major accounting-fraud scandals beginning with Enron Corp.Among strong supporters of stock-option expensing as a means to improve the accuracy of financial statements are Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary John Snow, and Securities and Exchange Commission William Donaldson. Mr. Greenspan warned Congress earlier this year ""it would be a bad mistake for the Congress to impede FASB,"" because the proposed accounting for stock options ""strikes me as correct.""Still, the measure faces stiff opposition in the Senate.

94,"Brazil's Banker Gives Argentina History Lesson On Devaluation. BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine economic team, trying to find its footing following the devaluation of the peso, got a look at neighboring Brazil's playbook yesterday.At the invitation of Argentine colleagues, Brazilian Central Bank Gov. Arminio Fraga visited Buenos Aires yesterday to share the story of how Brazil pulled itself out of a similar financial crisis in 1999. Mr. Fraga met with Argentine Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov to discuss how Brazil managed a significant devaluation of the Brazilian real, which boosted exports, while keeping inflation to single-digit rates.The talks were punctuated by the sound of demonstrators beating drums, chanting and blocking traffic outside government ministries in this bankrupt capital city. Meanwhile, in the far north, gangs of the unemployed broke windows at utility and bank offices.Argentina, after linking its currency 1-1 to the U.S. dollar for a decade, last week devalued the peso by 29% to an official rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar. Since then, the peso has dropped even more on a parallel free market. It closed at 1.85 to the dollar yesterday, down from 1.70 Monday. In the meantime, the new government of President Eduardo Duhalde is scurrying to put together an economic plan that will allow angry Argentines to access bank accounts that have been partially frozen for the past six weeks.Yesterday, Mr. Fraga ""discussed Brazil's experience in 1999 moving from a fixed to a floating exchange rate and Brazil's experience with inflation targeting,"" said Thais Heredia, a spokeswoman for Brazil's central bank. Within six months of the devaluation, Mr. Fraga formally implemented a system of using inflation targets to govern interest rates.

After a spring of extraordinary diplomatic rancor, world leaders gathering this weekend in Evian, France, for the annual economic summit are facing rising concerns about their broad commitment to a globalized economy.The summit isn't expected to lead to any significant economic accords. Rather, it will be watched to see if the leaders of the world's largest economies, who had split badly over the Iraq war, can come together symbolically. That could make a difference to markets, who worry that the divisions of foreign affairs and military strategy would spread into the economic sphere.The world economy already faces a variety of concerns ranging from the falling dollar to the spread of deflation in Asia and the threat of it in Europe and North America. A continuing split between the U.S. and Britain on the one hand, and France, Germany and Italy on the other would undermine confidence that those governments could put together a unified economic strategy. One clue to look for: Whether the summit participants agree how the rebuilding of postwar Iraq should proceed now that United Nations sanctions have been lifted.""There was a tendency in the '90s to feel that globalization would very likely continue,"" said Robert Rubin, the former U.S. treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and now a Citigroup executive. ""But there is obviously a much greater backlash than expected and more uncertainty about it moving forward.""In some ways, the world is similar to when economic summits began 28 years ago. During the first summit in November 1975 in Rambouillet, France, trade-liberalization talks had collapsed; India had exploded a nuclear bomb the year before, heightening fears of nuclear proliferation; and the dollar was falling after the U.S. abandoned the gold standard several years earlier.",0,1.0,0.0,3420

The splendid Benaroya symphony hall, built with donations from Seattle's prosperous global firms, was crammed over the weekend with an impressively global assortment of globalization's critics. Along the sleek slate-and-steel hallway, activists from five continents clustered by the latte bars: African campaigners for debt relief, Brazilian defenders of rain forests, Indians opposed to neocolonial investment, European haters of beef hormones, Canadians concerned about everything.Inside the auditorium, a marathon teach-in was underway, convened to denounce the World Trade Organization as ""one of the world's most powerful, secretive, undemocratic and dangerous bodies."" And yet this festival of activism suggested a rather different notion. Perhaps the activists themselves are the real stealth world government?Last time trade liberalizing talks were launched, in Uruguay in 1986, 12 nongovernmental organizations registered to observe the process. But the reach and clout of NGOs have since expanded marvelously, courtesy of the Internet. NGOs set the agenda for the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and lobbied governments to attend; they publicized the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico in 1994, so preventing the Mexican government from suppressing it violently. Three years ago Jessica Mathews, now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested that centuries of governmental dominance might finally be ending.If that was plausible three years ago, it now seems even more compelling. In 1997 a loose alliance of 350 NGOs from 23 countries set out to ban land mines; they soon persuaded 122 nations to sign on to a treaty. In 1998 another NGO alliance, this time reckoned to number 600 groups in nearly 70 countries, sank a painstakingly negotiated treaty on multilateral investment. This year yet another coalition, known as Jubilee 2000, led an international lobbying effort for Third World debt relief. During the recent budget fight, Jubilee pressure had much to do with the congressional Republicans' last-minute assent to provide money for debt cancellation.Fresh from those victories, the NGO community has descended on Seattle to take on the international trading system. Many of the lead players from previous NGO victories are there; they greet each other in hallways with the camaraderie of veterans. Their rhetoric paints the World Trade Organization as a proto-government possessed of frightening power, but their own clout is just as striking. The WTO has a budget of just $80 million a year and a staff of fewer than 500. NGO coalitions wield more money and have thousands of expert delegates in Seattle.",0,1.0,0.0,2396

Target-date funds drew a lot of criticism during the bear market for big losses. Whether or not the criticism was deserved, one thing is clear: Average investors need to better understand the risks and benefits of these popular retirement-savings vehicles.Designed as hands-off, long-term holdings, target-date funds typically contain a retirement year in their names and shift to a more conservative asset mix as that year approaches. But as the market tanked in late 2008 and even supposedly conservative funds for people retiring in 2010 took a hit, questions arose about how well people really grasp these products.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro has asked her staff to prepare rule recommendations about how target-date funds are marketed, and the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration plans to require fund providers to give plan participants more information about target-date funds when they are among the default options in retirement-savings programs such as 401(k)s.Target-date funds rebounded strongly along with the broad stock market last year.

Just since 1999, the dollar has moved from $1.17 per euro to $0.83 in 2001, and to $1.27 today, matching moves in the dollar's value in terms of gold and commodities. The impact of this volatility on U.S. farmers and manufacturers, developing countries, tourism, and investment flows has been immense and disruptive.At last weekend's G7 meeting, the powerful group of finance ministers and central bankers accepted this, asserting that exchange rates should be flexible and reflect economic fundamentals. The U.S. hopes the G7 language will form a lasting consensus and be viewed as a set of long-term currency principles. But there's a hitch: Rather than ""reflecting"" fundamentals, the exchange rate is itself a key fundamental. It affects capital flows, jobs, inflation, and interest rates. Currency changes harm the relationship between debtors and creditors and dominate the profitability of many companies.Without considering the exchange rate, there is not even a ballpark economic definition of a country's fundamentals -- one can't tell whether monetary policy is tight or loose, or inflation likely to rise or fall. If the idea is that strong economic fundamentals cause a strong currency -- as the Clinton administration argued -- it is unclear why the Bush administration seems so comfortable with the two- year weakness in the dollar. It surely doesn't agree with the dollar- bears' claim that U.S. fundamentals have deteriorated substantially due to the tax cuts and fiscal deficits.My view is the opposite. U.S. fundamentals are much better now than in 2000, in large part due to the change in the value of the dollar and the improved tax structure. The fundamentals are reflected in important new records in GDP, total employment according to the household survey, corporate profits, productivity and disposable personal income. The U.S. potential growth rate in coming years is one of the best on record, and hard to explain if the current value of the dollar is thought to ""reflect"" economic fundamentals.The irony in the fascination with the G7's exchange-rate language is that the causal relationship from economic fundamentals to currencies works so poorly. The dollar reached its peak value in 2001 after the recession started. Dollar strength wasn't the sole cause -- lax regulation plus high tax rates, interest rates, and oil prices contributed -- but the dollar certainly didn't reflect U.S. fundamentals.",0,1.0,0.0,1203

117,"Full Senate to vote on Bernanke; PANEL ADVANCES RENOMINATION Sharp debate hints at difficult confirmation. Ben S. Bernanke cleared a key hurdle Thursday to being confirmed for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman, but the discussion and vote by a Senate committee suggested that confirmation is not a foregone conclusion.The banking committee voted 16 to 7 to send Bernanke's nomination for another four-year term to the full Senate when his current one expires Jan. 31. While it still appears likely that Bernanke will be confirmed, the tense debate foreshadowed what could be the most controversial confirmation of a Fed chairman since at least the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker was reappointed during a deep recession.The majority of senators argued that Bernanke deserves reappointment for his aggressive actions to contain the financial crisis and prevent an even deeper economic downturn.But many of the votes in Bernanke's favor -- which came from four of 10 Republicans and 12 of 13 Democrats -- were accompanied by significant misgivings about the weak economy and failures by the Fed that contributed to the financial crisis. Some senators who voted to move the nomination forward did not commit to voting for his confirmation on the Senate floor.Time could be Bernanke's enemy. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene after a holiday recess on Jan. 19, and banking committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) expects the body will only then take up Bernanke's confirmation. That will leave just nine business days for the Senate to act before Bernanke's term expires. Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) has said he will put a hold on the nomination, a procedural step that could delay a vote and means that Bernanke would need 60 votes to remain chairman.",0,1.0,0.0,2073

No other aspect of personal computing attracts so much emotion, or lands so much hate-mail in journalists' in boxes accusing them of bias. To make my own background clear: I've got a Mac on my desk at home and a PC on my desk at work. I swear at both. If it means anything, I've gotten a little more hate-mail from Apple advocates than PC partisans.But apart from those true believers, there are people who would just like to know which platform will be a better fit for their own purposes. There's no right answer, but here are a few things to ponder:Cost: At the entry level, there's no longer a big difference between the prices of Macs and PCs. The cheapest PC-and-monitor combo with 64 megabytes of memory (a realistic minimum) at Best Buy's site costs $580 after a rebate. The cheapest iMac system available costs $800. That $220 isn't pocket change, but it's not a huge gap, either.Apple stays roughly competitive with its rivals throughout the iMac line. But between $1,500 and $2,000, Apple has nothing to compete with Windows machines. If you're looking for a computer with some open expansion slots and a 17-inch monitor, a desktop PC will be awfully cheap compared to a Power Mac G4.Reliability: Both operating systems crash. A lot. Yes, it's possible to fine-tune either system to a remarkable degree of stability, but most users have neither the time nor the aptitude for that kind of tweaking.

WASHINGTON -- Prospects for raising deposit-insurance limits sank yesterday when an influential senator invited the Bush administration to propose a law that would probably exclude such an increase.Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) asked the administration to submit a legislative proposal on overhauling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The administration strongly opposes raising coverage from its current $100,000 per depositor per institution.The move jeopardizes competing proposals, one that passed the House overwhelmingly last year and has been reintroduced by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley (R., Ohio) this year, and another sponsored by Sen. Tim Johnson (D., S.D.). Both would boost the limit to $130,000 and index coverage thereafter for inflation.""Coverage increases pose a serious threat to taxpayers that could far outweigh the marginal benefits to depositors or the banking system,"" Mr. Shelby said after hearing testimony from the Treasury and the four federal banking regulators, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.Except for FDIC Chairman Donald Powell, all oppose increasing coverage limits, arguing it would encourage banks to lend recklessly with the taxpayer underwriting the risk.

Federal workers have seven working days to make what could be two of the key decisions of their careers: whether to join the thrift savings plan and where to invest the money. Joining the plan is a no-brainer. Just do it. Deciding where to invest takes more thought.For many young workers, the right long-term investment could mean a million extra dollars to spend in retirement. Experts say that savings plan accounts will produce half of the retirement income of workers covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.Employees who miss the Jan. 31 deadline to join the plan will have to wait until the end of the year for the next open season.

The G-fund has no risk, in the sense that it is guaranteed by the government. It is invested in Treasury securities with a guaranteed monthly rate.

WASHINGTON--Regulators are close to issuing a rule designed to provide relief to banks that want to own certain types of debt investments without running afoul of the so-called Volcker rule, according to people briefed on the matter.Regulatory agencies are planning to issue an interim final rule this week that would allow banks to hold some collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, as long as they meet certain criteria, such as containing specific types of loans, these people said.Regulators haven't made a final decision, but people familiar with the matter said the agencies want to allow most small banks to avoid having to divest the securities, though the impact could vary by institution. Regulators have promised a decision on the Volcker rule provision by Wednesday.The change under consideration comes in response to pressure from Capitol Hill and a lawsuit from the banking industry, which last month challenged the Volcker rule's restriction on banks' holding of CDOs made up of trust-preferred securities. The CDOs at issue often are made up of debt issued by banks that was then bundled together and sold to investors, including other banks.The Dec. 10 release of the Volcker rule, which bans banks from making certain investments, took some small firms by surprise because it applied the ban to certain CDO holdings.

Jenkins, Jr.You can hardly turn over an investing advice newsletter without finding a recommendation to buy TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, to preserve the purchasing power of your dollar-denominated savings.Economists and investment pros look out three years and can't believe we aren't due for a powerful flush of inflation. The usefulness of their favorite hedging advice, however, depends on the U.S. government actually carrying out the promise embodied in TIPS, honestly to apply an inflation adjustment to protect holders from loss of purchasing power due to the government's own mismanagement of the currency.Will the spirit and letter of this guarantee be observed? The question has to be asked because Washington has shown no hesitancy to delegitimize legitimate claims by vilifying those asserting them--GM and Chrysler debt holders being the most recent examples. By the time the TIPS question comes up, moreover, the slope will likely have been greased by states and municipalities reneging on promises made to government retirees and bond investors. It will have been greased by governments around the world setting example after example of the many flavors of default. The justice or lack thereof in each such case is not the question. What matters is to recognize that government promises are not written in stone.Take Japan: It has debt in the hands of its citizens amounting to an improbable 225% of its non-growing GDP, at a time when an aging citizenry will be wanting to cash out its savings to support its retirement, including workers and business owners now prematurely retired by the recent earthquake and tsunami. Already policy makers at the Bank of Japan are openly talking about using the central bank's printing press to finance rebuilding, incidentally setting course to inflate away some of the government's existing obligations.",0,0.6777,0.32230000000000003,2662

129,"Boom Here, Panic There. Reading recent congressional testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, I had a scary thought: He doesn't know any more than I do. By this, I don't mean to compare myself with Greenspan. He's forgotten more about the economy than I'll ever know. Beyond that, the Fed has a staff of 228 economists and is constantly briefed by companies, banks and governments about individual markets and industries. What's sobering is that despite these advantages, Greenspan still seems genuinely baffled by the economy's dazzling performance and its future direction. Precisely. The old adage now seems to apply: If you're not confused, you don't understand the situation.On the one hand, the U.S. economy is booming beyond belief. In the past year it has created 3.1 million jobs; the unemployment rate (4.6 percent in February) hasn't been lower since March 1970. Measured inflation is declining. In the past year the consumer price index has risen only 1.6 percent. Consumer optimism is at lofty heights; the Conference Board's confidence index touched 138 in February (1985 equals 100), a level not seen since the late 1960s. On the other hand, the news from Asia isn't getting better. China's economy is slowing; Japan may slip into a recession (a drop in output). Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund are in a virtual state of war.Including China and India, Asia represents about 30 percent of the world economy. Yet its troubles haven't spoiled American spending or spirits. One explanation is that the benefits of the crisis have come before the costs. The biggest benefit has been lower interest rates, which have triggered a surge in mortgage refinancings. Frightened by Asia's problems, global investors shifted funds into U.S. bonds and mortgage securities. Bond prices rose; interest rates dropped. Investors accepted lower interest rates in exchange for more safety. In early 1997, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged almost 8 percent; in 1998 they've hovered around 7 percent.Economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates the resulting explosion of mortgage refinancings will total about $400 billion in 1998. On a $120,000 loan, someone going from 8 percent to 7 percent would save nearly $1,000 a year. Lower rates have also sustained a high level of home buying and selling. For 1998, Lereah expects 4.24 million existing homes to be sold, a record. Americans are moving into more appealing homes and, in the process, doing a lot of redecorating and renovating.The second big benefit from Asia has been the plunge in oil prices. Since early 1997 they've dropped from $25 a barrel to $15. The United States now consumes 6.8 billion barrels of oil a year, says economist Michael Canes of the American Petroleum Institute. At the lower prices, consumers would save almost $70 billion. Average gasoline prices have dropped to about $1 a gallon from $1.20 a year ago; they could go lower. Part of the gain is a wealth transfer from U.S. oil producers to U.S. consumers, but the gain on our imports -- half our oil use -- is pure windfall. Asia's crisis has cut demand, and ""the cartel {OPEC} is falling apart,"" Canes says. Countries violate their OPEC quotas. Supply rises, demand softens; prices fall.",0,1.0,0.0,511

131,"Letters to the Editor: Some Positive Trends In Outsourcing Market. In your Nov. 16 Technology Journal article ""Outsourcing Firms Shift Gears in Tight Market,"" the outsourcing development may be quite positive for the industry. As you point out, the U.S. outsourcing market is changing and 1999 revenues that were inflated by Y2K and ERP spending are unlikely to reappear anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are many positive trends, including global expansion of outsourcing to offset slower growth in a more mature U.S. market, greater spending on infrastructure, applications management and network services to facilitate the transition to e-business, and an aging federal information technology staff that will accelerate federal sector outsourcing, especially to enable e-government.If the so-called outsourcing dinosaurs have been outflanked by their smaller, newer competitors, the tide may well be reversing in favor of size, broad experience and financial staying power as the scramble for qualified IT staff intensifies. At a time when corporate IT departments and governmental agencies alike are confronting a work force nearing retirement, new IT graduates favor established outsourcers and shun the civil service. This will only intensify the trend toward outsourcing.If so, stock investors would be well advised to adopt a longer-term investment horizon. Announcements of layoffs should be understood as normal repositionings by outsourcers that acquire new staff with each contract win. They don't necessarily presage revenue shortfalls, and the growth of revenues from non-U.S. market doesn't signal a souring of the U.S. market.Albert NekimkenVice President",0,1.0,0.0,2828

Nobody-not the financial markets, not the public, not the Bush administration and not Congress-is really worried about the current level of inflation, says economist Joel Popkin, because it still looks good in comparison with the late 1970s and early '80s.""Back in the '60s and early '70s,"" says Popkin, whose consulting firm specializes in tracking inflation, ""we used to worry about `creeping' inflation-inflation in the 5 to 6 percent range. Nixon put in price controls when inflation was just about where it is now."" But ever since the second OPEC oil shock sent prices spiraling, ""double-digit inflation has become the standard against which to measure."" Anything less than that doesn't get us excited.Popkin can point to plenty of supporting evidence: After a brief flurry of concern, the financial markets shrugged off the sharp jump in consumer prices-and an even sharper jump in producer prices-recorded in January; consumer confidence is running at a 20-year high (though purchases of autos and other interest-sensitive consumer durables have sagged a bit); and both the administration and Congress have registered less than enthusiasm for Chairman Greenspan's anti-inflation crusade.That's too bad. If inflation is building up a head of steam, the only way to diffuse it short of a deep recession is for everyone to start checking their inflationary impulses. Businesses need to moderate price hikes and profit margins, workers must moderate wage and benefit demands and, most important, businesses, workers-and government-need to consume less and save more so that U.S. productive capacity can expand.

Federal Reserve policy makers will meet today to decide whether the abrupt slowing in economic and money supply growth requires an active easing of monetary policy.Money supply growth has been very weak and well below the FedUas short-term targets since July. Economic growth has slowed to the point that an increasing number of forecasters, while not predicting a recession, do not rule one out.Federal Reserve officials are concerned about the slowdown in the expansion, particularly because there are no signs of any acceleration in inflation. In addition, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and other Reagan administration officials recently began strongly urging the Fed to adopt an easier money policy.Given those facts, many financial analysts predict that the policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, will act to provide more reserves to the banking | system and encourage interest rates, which have dropped sharply in the last two months, at least to ; stay down or perhaps continue to , fall.For instance, economist Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers predicted that the FOMC ""will formulate a strategy that will validate the current interest rate structureU and move the federal funds rateUOthe interest that financial institution* charge when they lend reserves to each otherUOdown UIinto the 9U/aE percent to 9l/z percent area.U The funds rate has been declining but generally has been closer to 10 percent than to 9'/2 percent.",0,0.6806,0.3194,2430

143,"REGIONS: Novel California Pension Plan Provides an Inflation Antidote. IN CALIFORNIA, retired state and local government workers are benefiting from an innovative plan that helps keep pension income from being wiped out by inflation. But local governments, who pay the lion's share of the retirement benefits, think the system has serious flaws.It's called IDDA, short for Investment Dividend Disbursement Account, and it's unique to California. The legislature this year voted to extend the plan until Jan. 1, 1994, despite grumbling by city and county governments and taxpayer groups. IDDA's fans note that the plan is paying an annual $127 million bonus to certain retired members of the Public Employee's Retirement System whose pension benefits have been eroded by inflation -- all without taking a dime from the state budget.Critics say the trick is done by grabbing interest-bearing funds from employee retirement accounts before they get into the general retirement fund. As a result, employers end up paying more into pension funds than they otherwise would, the opponents say.No one argues with IDDA's goal -- easing the financial strain of retired workers. A state employee who retired in 1975 with a $1,000 monthly retirement check has seen the purchasing power of that check cut in half. Regular and special cost-of-living adjustments have supplemented the monthly allotment, but these occasional payments cost the state a bundle without making up much of the considerable ground that elderly retirees have lost to inflation.IDDA MAKES THE LOSS less severe. It kicks in enough money to bring retirees' monthly benefits to 75% of their original purchasing power.

145,"Investors Move to Consumer Stocks --- Food, Retail Issues Rose as the Market Fell in 3rd Quarter. Jittery investors pinned their hopes on consumer and insurance stocks last quarter -- a stock market trend that some experts say may continue for a while.During the third quarter, the overall market declined slightly, as shown by the 1.4% fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But that masks a distinct switch in investors' preferences. An analysis of the Dow Jones Industry Groups shows that food, retail and other consumer stocks averaged gains of 5% to 13% for the quarter. Meanwhile, technology stocks took a pounding throughout the quarter, reversing their gains of earlier this year.""If people are looking for a way to put money back in the stock market without blowing off their hand, these stocks {large-capitalization consumer issues} are the way to do it,"" says Michael Sherman, a portfolio strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Such stocks are expected to hold up relatively well in a recession, he observes.As a case in point, Scott McKay, a vice president at HT Investors Inc., says his Providence, R.I., money-management concern is emphasizing consumer stocks ""as a defensive move."" Recent economic signals have been confusing, he says. But he figures that if equity prices slump, consumer stocks and some depressed financial issues ""won't go down as much as the rest of the market.""Of the 10 best performing industry groups last quarter, four were in consumer sectors.

146,"Gaining Capital. Some people continue to believe, or at least still assert, that tax rates don't influence taxpayer behavior all that much. We therefore direct their attention to the Treasury Department's latest historical data on revenues from taxes on capital gains.The numbers look like a 25-year demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action. As the nearby chart shows, taxes paid on capital gains have been highly responsive to the maximum capital gains tax rate. (See accompanying table -- WSJ Jan. 24, 2005) Especially notable is how, over the years, capital gains realizations and the taxes paid on those gains have tended to increase in the years following a cut in the capital gains tax rate.The reductions highlighted in the chart include the famous William Steiger tax rate cut that passed Congress in late 1978 over Jimmy Carter's objections, the Reagan tax cut passed in 1981, and the cut that was part of the Clinton-Gingrich balanced budget deal of 1997. All of those reductions caused taxpayers to cash in more of their gains and thus yielded revenue windfalls for the federal Treasury in succeeding years.On the other hand, the capital gains tax increase of 1986 -- which moved the rate back up to 28% from 20% -- proved to be a revenue disaster. Taxes paid on long-term capital gains (those typically held longer than one year) fell off a cliff to $33.7 billion in 1987 from $52.9 billion a year earlier. And they stayed at close to that mediocre lower level for nearly another decade. In other words, higher rates didn't do anyone any good, not even the politicians who thought they'd be getting more tax revenue to spend.We aren't asserting that tax-rate changes have been the only factors influencing revenue changes. The performance of the broader economy and the stock market have also mattered a great deal. Capital gains revenues boomed in the late 1990s after the 1997 rate cut, but they fell abruptly with the bursting of the dot-com and tech bubbles in 2001.",0,1.0,0.0,2276

Quite a difference!Greenspan's purpose in bringing up the overstatement of inflation in the economy was to make the valid point that various government programs, such as Social Security and military and civilian pensions, that are indexed to the cost of living have provided overgenerous cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), thus adding to the federal deficit.""For example,"" Greenspan said, ""if the annual inflation adjustments to indexed programs and taxes were reduced by one percentage point - and making the admittedly strong assumption that there are no other changes in the economy - the annual level of the deficit will be lower by about $55 billion after five years, including the effects of lower debt levels.""",0,0.7121,0.28790000000000004,75

155,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Lawson's Lesson. For the first 25 years after World War II, exchange-rate stability was achieved through the Bretton Woods system. This formed a cornerstone of the postwar economic order, not least as a force for financial discipline. But it began to break down in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s it had collapsed altogether. Thereafter, with countries pursuing divergent economic policies, and many suffering from high and volatile inflation, a system of floating exchange rates was virtually inescapable. Indeed, many at the time believed this new flexibility to be desirable. With hindsight, some of the arguments for free floating seem much less compelling. And the belief that markets would provide a stabilizing influence, through the operations of medium-term speculators, has not been borne out.That summary of our recent experience was offered last September by Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, in a speech to the annual meeting of the governors of the International Monetary Fund. Among those who attend IMF meetings he no doubt found much agreement; indeed, this view has recently dominated international economic management as expressed by the Plaza and Louvre accords. Yet few economists have caught up with the world's finance ministers, and even fewer politicians. So it is not surprising that the economic news in Britain these past few weeks has centered on Mr. Lawson's troubles selling this view to his cabinet superior, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Mr. Lawson prevailed last week, at least for now, when Mrs. Thatcher endorsed his policy of trying to stabilize the pound, rather than let the markets continue to bid it up. But the current British experience, repeating as it does American experience, has lessons for everyone in a world economy in transition.Britain's problem is its success. Its GNP is expanding at an annual rate of 4.3%. It is the second-fastest-growing country, after Japan, in the Group of Five industrial economies. Britain is now so attractive that it's sucking in investment capital much faster than competing economies. The excitement has been growing following the historic supply-side budget Mr. Lawson delivered in March, reducing top marginal rates of income tax to 40%. Both France and West Germany maintain top marginal rates of about 56%, and France's Socialist government is pledging not to lower its rate.With vigorous economic activity and the promise of more to come in that part of the world where money is counted in pounds, there has naturally been a surge in the demand for pounds. If the Bank of England satisfies this demand by creating more money, Sterling-M-Whatever will soar, disturbing the astrologers who follow the movements of these ethereal bodies. If the Bank of England fails to satisfy this new demand, the value of the pound will soar.",0,0.6726,0.3274,3867

For its Topic A feature last Sunday, The Post invited a panel of political operatives to offer their advice to the Democratic Party on strategy for 2010 [Sunday Opinion, Jan. 10]. Improbably, one of the operatives asked was Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's longtime chief strategist.Rove has some impressive campaign victories to his credit. But given the shape in which the last administration left this country, I'm not sure I would solicit his advice. And given the backhanded advice he offered, I'm not sure he was all that eager to help.Of all the claims Rove made, one in particular caught my eye for its sheer audacity and shamelessness -- that congressional Democrats ""will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years.""The day the Bush administration took over from President Bill Clinton in 2001, America enjoyed a $236 billion budget surplus -- with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. When the Bush administration left office, it handed President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit -- and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion for the next decade. During eight years in office, the Bush administration passed two major tax cuts skewed to the wealthiest Americans, enacted a costly Medicare prescription-drug benefit and waged two wars, without paying for any of it.To put the breathtaking scope of this irresponsibility in perspective, the Bush administration's swing from surpluses to deficits added more debt in its eight years than all the previous administrations in the history of our republic combined. And its spending spree is the unwelcome gift that keeps on giving: Going forward, these unpaid-for policies will continue to add trillions to our deficit.",0,0.695,0.30500000000000005,505

The Federal Reserve continues to work on the plumbing that will eventually drain the flood of cash it has pumped into the financial system.On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced it was further broadening the pool of those eligible to take part in reverse-repurchase agreements, expected to be a key tool the Fed will use to exit from the accommodative policy stance it has been in since the financial crisis hit in 2008.The criteria set forth Tuesday would allow U.S. government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to apply to participate in reverse-repurchase agreements, in which the central bank sells securities from its portfolio to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back later.Under the arrangement, the buyers essentially lend cash to the Fed, removing reserves from the system.""They're sharpening their tools here.

165,"Barter for Exports pg-c-  . Countertrade is a form of barter or linked trading. U,S, companies need countertrade because it is a valuable marketing tool and a financing instrument when traditional financing is not available. The U.S. government needs countertrade, especially in the form of a weapons sales offset policy, because all our major trading partnersUOCanada, Europe, JapanUO use it on us.Here are some examples of how countertrade can work. Using barter financing, Wes-tinghouse recently sold a $100 million air defense radar system to Jordan. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) financing through the Pentagon was not available, nor were other traditional financing instruments. However, the Jordanians were willing to pay for the system with phosphate, The large Japanese trading company, Mitsubishi, has already sold most of the phosphate, and the safe has proceeded fairly smoothly.In another case involving the area of military offsets, General Dynamics was required by Turkey to put together a countertrade package, valued at more than $1 billion, as a cemerpiece or us recent $4.rs ouuon sale ot F-16s to that important NATO country. The package included technology transfer and investment in Tusas, the Turkish aircraft company, along with a commitment to export assorted products out of Turkey. Turkey was hard-pressed for valuable foreign exchange and needed the countertrade package, as well as FMS financing from the Pentagon, to justify the transaction politically.Every major U.S. trading partner almost routinely requires some variation of an offset package as part of the price for making a large sale. Thus France and Britain required Boeing to supplement their recent airborne radar (AWACs) sale to those countries with an offset package worth 30 percent more than the sale itself, West Germany required a $500 million offset from Raytheon for a 1984 Patriot missile sale, and the Canadians required Sperry to offer an offset package that established an electronics company in Canada before purchasing $3 billion in electronics for their navy. The Japanese have made some form of technology transfer a pre-condition for several military purchases from the United States, a ir strong dollar alone did not alone cause the U.S. trade deficit, and the current weaker dollar cannot completely eliminate it. To address the trade deficit, the United States should consider countertrade.This country should begin multilateral negotiations with our trading partners to curb their growing appetite for offsets, and should start an offset policy of our own. The focus should be on our allies, and not on U.S. companies, who in the fiercely competitive world should be free to make their best offset offer.",0,1.0,0.0,279

The IMF, Mr. Koehler told top officials from 182 member nations, must ""make globalization work for the benefit of all.""His effort to focus the IMF on emergency loans for better-off developing countries, and on poverty reduction and debt relief for the worst-off, won't convince the IMF's harshest critics, who believe its economic prescriptions favor corporations over the poor and the environment.

Super University of Michigan Press. 528 pp. $35 ""FAVOURED BY practice and original endowment,"" said an anonymous critic in England's Saturday Review, Anthony Trollope ""can write novels as easily as a hen lays eggs."" He wrote 47 of them in just under four decades, and in the bumper year of 1864 polished off half of one long novel and all of two medium-length ones, a total of more than half-a-million words. He managed the prodigious output of that and many other years while acting as a husband, father, and full-time bureaucrat in the British Post Office-a job he performed with distinction. One secret of his productivity came to light when Thackeray's daughter spent a few days chez Trollope: ""She was astonished to hear Trollope called by the servant every morning at four to take up his writing task for the day.""His father was a feckless barrister who moved the family to Harrow so that Anthony and his brothers could attend the prestigious parish school as day-boys without charge. After bailiffs seized the family's belongings for nonpayment of debts, Anthony's mother embarked on a writing career. In addition to novels she wrote a travel book, Domestic Manners of the Americans, which took the pulse of Yankee culture and found it erratic. The book made her career and restored the family's position.Nonetheless, Anthony skipped university and entered civil service because, he later allowed, ""an early income was desirable."" He married, rose slowly in the ranks, and published a few novels with indifferent success. It was in his fifth book, Barchester Towers, in which he blended his satirical gifts with disdain for evangelical puritanism, that he found himself. There he introduced Mrs. Proudie, wife of the bishop of Barsetshire and wearer of the episcopal pants, the first of his peerless termagants. He wrote five other novels set in the mythical county of Barsetshire; in The Last Chronicle of Barset-from which R.H. Super takes the title of this admirable biography, one that stands out from other lives of Trollope by not taking his Autobiography at face value-he made sport of his dual careers by having Mrs. Proudie campaign to ban mail delivery on The Lord's Day.He also wrote a six-volume series of ""Parliamentary"" novels centered on that reluctant prime minister, Plantaganet Palliser, the eventual Duke of Omnium-an achievement that pundits as disparate as George Will and Anthony Lewis have commended in their columns. Trollope's non-ecclesiastical, non-parliamentary novels tend to be about nothing more momentous than the ethics of inheritance, courtship and marriage, and some readers revere him exactly for this Austenite strain.",0,1.0,0.0,4766

202,"Offshore Outsourcing Finds Fans at Fed Forum. JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Globalization, the conventional wisdom goes, has downsides: It hurts the wages of the lesser skilled. It leads to large and possibly dangerous trade imbalances. It can threaten economic stability through financial-market volatility.But academics, investment bankers and government officials at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium here heard a much more upbeat vision of a globally integrated world. For example, it is usually said that outsourcing work from a high-wage country, such as the U.S., to lower-wage ones -- also dubbed ""offshoring"" -- makes workers in the richer country's affected industries worse off, but the country as a whole better off, because consumers enjoy lower prices on the products made overseas. But Gene Grossman and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg of Princeton University argued that offshoring can lead to higher wages for unskilled U.S. workers.""Things may be better than they would have been had there been no offshoring,"" Mr. Grossman said. When a company offshores some work, its remaining workers become more productive. It can thus expand, hire more workers -- perhaps even some of those whose work was offshored -- to do jobs that can't be offshored, and it can pay at least some of them more.The proof is that wages of unskilled, blue-collar workers didn't do worse than they actually did between 1997 and 2004, given two strong, offsetting economic forces: the surge in productivity, or output per hour of work, which should have lifted their wages, and the decline in prices of imports, which should have pushed down their wages by lowering the prices of the competing goods these workers made.Anthony Venables of the London School of Economics argued that when an industry in a rich country starts trading with a poor country, the wages in the rich country may actually pull further away from those in the poor country, instead of converging down to the lower level as standard economic theory predicts. The reason? The industry in the rich country may rely on many local inputs that its competitors in a new foreign market don't have -- access to specialized workers, for example, or daily face-to-face contact with competitors and customers.",0,0.7258,0.2742,3381

Milton Friedman says that blaming the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act for the 1929 stock-market crash and the subsequent Depression gives it too much ""credit."" (""Outdoing Smoot-Hawley,"" editorial page, April 20.) No doubt that's because the act wasn't passed until a year after the crash and simply gave a final boost to the very high tariffs of the prosperous '20s. But ""protectionist"" policies don't have to lead to a '30s-type contraction in world trade as Mr. Friedman warns.Mr. Friedman says that despite Japanese auto restraints, the U.S. auto industry has prospered only by selling overseas or building cars with mostly Japanese parts. That's certainly not true in Chrysler's case -- our vehicles contain almost 90% domestic content (averaging in built-up cars and engines we import), our sales are almost totally North American (though we plan to move back into Europe), our productivity soared by more than 45% over four years, and our quality is back to world standards. Chrysler is living proof (and so is Japanese industry, which grew behind protectionist barriers) that selective government interventions can have positive outcomes if carefully applied.The administration's recent decision to put 100% tariffs on certain items has already elicited from Japan more promises for systemic change than years of trade negotiations. But those promises won't translate into real change unless they are backed by a clear and consistent legislative policy, such as that contained in the much-misrepresented Gephardt amendment. Other policy tools have failed (sectoral negotiations) or been pushed to near their practical limits (exchange-rate adjustments). Allowing America's huge trade imbalance to persist will produce far less palatable adjustments (high interest rates, U.S. or even world economic contraction) than would the sensible assertion of this country's bottom-line interests.Robert A.

The Texas Air president is perceived by many airline industry employees as anti-labor, and Western is 17%-owned by its workers.But many analysts think Western's earnings turnaround in itself makes the stock a good buy. This year is shaping up as the company's first profitable one since 1979.

215,"Why Icahn Is Betting on WCI's Florida Condos. Amid softening home prices, rising foreclosures and turmoil in the mortgage industry, billionaire financier Carl Icahn is making a contrarian bet on a troubled pocket of the U.S. housing market: high- end Florida condominiums.How Mr. Icahn fares with his wager could help answer whether this state's housing downturn is a cloud that will soon blow over or a storm that will linger for years. The board of WCI Communities Inc., a home builder that has erected hundreds of high-rise condos along the Florida coast, could decide today whether to accept Mr. Icahn's tender offer of $22 a share for the builder that many consider a good barometer for the state's priciest real estate. That offer, which totals about $920 million, is slightly higher than WCI's $21.45 price yesterday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Mr. Icahn's pursuit of WCI has puzzled many on Wall Street who believe the Bonita Springs, Fla., company is highly exposed to the swelling glut of condos dotting Florida beaches and golf courses. In the fourth quarter, WCI, which has a market value of about $909 million, had more defaults on condos and cancellations of typical single-family homes, which it also builds, than it received orders for new homes.Mr. Icahn appears to be counting on Florida real estate to make a comeback. ""My investment philosophy, generally, with exceptions, is to buy something when no one wants it,"" he said yesterday. ""We made a fairly large investment and took control of several energy companies seven or eight years ago when they were way down. Housing is somewhat analogous.""Mr. Icahn, who has put up a slate of nominees for the WCI board, declines to comment on what, if any, plans he has for the company. In a Jan. 16 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Icahn said he beneficially held 14.5%, or 6.1 million shares, in WCI and that he intended to contact the company to discuss how to ""unlock the inherent value"" of its shares. His tender offer is conditioned on the WCI board pulling its recently enacted poison-pill provision intended to ward off hostile takeovers.

Why would Alan Greenspan, observing an American economy that in the eyes of most investors seems almost too good to be true, consciously cause a loss of more tjian 150 points and more than $100 billion in the stock market?The answer appears to be that Chairman Greenspan and the other members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors look askance at a buoyant stock market. Consultant Jude Wanniski, long an admirer of the chairman, told his clients last week: Tor all his qualities, Alan Greenspan still has embedded in him strands of.thinking that are oddly elitist in their distrust of markets.UThat distrust does not seem shared by elected representatives of the people either on Capitol Hill or in the White House.

Named to head the central bank by the last three presidents (two Republicans and one Democrat), he gets credit for the current stable economy. Mistakes in his long tenure there (including an unfortunate comment about dollar devaluation immediately preceding the 1987 stock market crash) have been erased from the public consciousness.Greenspan effectively is immune not only from systemic checks and balances under the Federal Reserve Act but from political restraints imposed on past chairmen, even his powerful and imperious predecessor, Paul Volcker.

235,"TWA Proposes To Buy Back All of Its Debt --- Ailing Airline Seeks to Shed Heavy Interest Burden, Offers Discounted Prices. Trans World Airlines, in a restructuring effort, proposed to purchase its $1.2 billion in outstanding debt for cash, offering debtholders deeply discounted prices.The move is an attempt to rid TWA of an expensive item -- interest expenses on the debt -- which has hamstrung the carrier since owner Carl Icahn took it private in 1988. The Mt. Kisco, N.Y., airline's highly leveraged position has grown more troublesome in recent months amid high jet fuel prices and the effects on air travel of the recession and the Mideast war. Since January, TWA has failed to meet interest and principal payments due on its debt.In another indication of TWA's troubles, the carrier yesterday posted a first-quarter net loss of $88.2 million, compared with a year-ago net loss of $143 million. This year's loss was narrowed by the recent $110 million sale of TWA's Chicago-London route authority to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.In the first quarter, TWA reported an operating loss of $144.4 million, wider than the year-earlier's $100.7 million operating loss. Revenue for the quarter fell 19% to $820.2 million from $1.01 billion a year-earlier.In the debt-purchase offer, Mr. Icahn estimates he personally would lose ""in excess"" of $40 million on TWA debt he holds. Still, some debt specialists believe a successful restructuring could strengthen the airline and make it a much more valuable property for Mr. Icahn, who controls 90% of its stock.",0,1.0,0.0,1899

By the composition of his Cabinet, heavily weighted with people who have carried the weight of office before, Bush has completed a process that Ronald Reagan began.It is the transformation of the Republican Party. The party now is reconciled to the reality of modern government's role in life. Republicans recognize that governance is a dignified, difficult, learned vocation for seasoned professionals such as Bush has chosen.Reagan's contribution to this process was his almost complete acceptance of the welfare state that evolved at a remarkably steady pace under his predecessors of both parties for half a century. Republicans remain free to talk like Jeffersonians, celebrating that government which governs least. But they live in, and want to be the dominant party in, Hamilton's America. It has a strong central government that requires a professional political class for the executive branch.Until recently, conservative ideology caused many Republicans to regard service in Washington as akin to jury duty. Perhaps it had to be done, but it was not supposed to be fun or fulfilling or for long. Bush's remarkably seamless transition testifies to a change.The passage into the Bush era began well before the election, with the installation of Bush supporters at Treasury (Nicholas Brady) and Justice (Richard Thornburgh). It speaks well of Bush's self-confidence that he has not been afraid to cobble together a large part of his administration from material at hand in Reagan's Washington.

Cal Ripken says he doesn't particularly want to talk about his torrid spring training, lest he jinx himself and ensure something like a zero-for-20 beginning to a most eagerly awaited regular season.But then he flashes an easy smile and consents, and what follows is the kind of analysis that does not bode well for American League pitchers. Ripken, who's hardly one for self-promotion, won't say it, but it's clear that the 30-year-old shortstop believes he has a banner season ahead of him. For perhaps the first time in 2 1/2 years, Cal Ripken is unburdened.Glenn Davis is here and Dwight Evans is here, and a lineup in which Ripken is sandwiched between Randy Milligan and that pair of slugging newcomers seems certain to assure more fastballs in more hittable locations than the eight-time all-star has seen in recent seasons. Ripken said today he no longer feels as if he has to shoulder the entire offensive burden for the Orioles, something he concedes he often has attempted to do since Eddie Murray was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers following the 1988 season.Ripken has resolved to take more pitches, and he's adamant about forcing pitchers to throw him strikes before he removes the bat from his shoulder. And with Davis - who had 164 home runs over the past six seasons in Houston - in the on-deck circle, pitchers may have little choice but to oblige.""Last year Cal felt like he had to carry the entire load,"" Orioles Manager Frank Robinson said.

243,"A Shrinking Burden; Pain Withheld: For Many, Tax Time Is Losing Some of Its Bite. From a working mother cleaning hotel rooms for a little more than the minimum wage to a computer-company executive bringing home almost half a million dollars a year, Americans across the economic spectrum will pay less of their income in federal taxes this year than they did 20 years ago.You read that right. It may be hard to believe when every street corner seems to have a politician claiming you're overtaxed and need a tax cut. But an analysis by the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm for The Washington Post shows that Reagan-era cuts for higher-income taxpayers, Clinton-era help for the working poor and targeted tax cuts contained in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement have all helped keep federal taxes for most Americans lower than they were in 1979.""To the extent that the economy has made everybody better off, they're better off and they're not paying as much tax as they would have under the old rules,"" said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche.This analysis might help explain why some of the oomph has gone out of the impact of tax-cut promises. Robert J. Dole's pledge to cut taxes across the board did little for his losing 1996 campaign against President Clinton. And recent polling indicates that Republican calls for another tax cut don't seem to excite many Americans. Most seem to prefer improving education or overhauling Social Security. Republicans argue that a tax cut is necessary because, by their analysis, when federal taxes are measured against the size of the overall economy, the federal tax burden is as high as it has been in more than half a century.Federal tax revenue is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to hit 20.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product this year (GDP is a common measure of the size of the economy). That would mark the second-highest level recorded since the dawn of the modern income tax in 1913. Tax revenue hit its highest level ever-- 20.9 percent of GDP--in 1944, when the federal government was extracting enormous amounts of tax revenue to finance World War II.",0,1.0,0.0,3402
244,"Got a Light?. As Christmas lights go up on homes around the country, you've probably noticed that the displays seem to get more elaborate every year. No longer does decorating a single evergreen in the front yard suffice. Every tree demands its own ropes of light, wrapping trunks and branches. Ubiquitous icicle lights drape even the most generic tract home in sparkling abundance. Arbiters of taste may clash over the merits of white versus colored bulbs, and energy Puritans may denounce the inessential use of electricity. But even stylistic snobs can't entirely deny the appeal of a thousand points of holiday light.Today's displays do more than brighten the night. They tell a story of economic progress. Like the electronic gadgets aimed at gift buyers, the tiny lights outlining roof lines illustrate new sources of growth and prosperity. Aesthetic pleasure, they tell us, is an increasingly important source of economic value and hence of new jobs and business opportunities. And the same trends that boost living standards in other areas also make Christmas lights more abundant. A holiday-lighting dollar goes a lot further than it used to. Homeowners buying Christmas lights benefit from the same intense competition that has driven down prices and improved reliability in so many other industries, raising our standard of living.When he was a teenager in the mid-'80s, David VanderMolen's job was to buy and install holiday lights for his family's Charlotte, Mich., home. Each year his parents would give him $10, enough for two 35- light strings, each 20 feet long, from Kmart. If the weather wasn't bad, a string would last three years. He eventually built up a collection of 350 light-strings, enough to make his house the most elaborately decorated in the neighborhood. Today, it would be nothing special. You can buy a 100-light string, 50 feet long, for $2.44 at Wal-Mart. Even without adjusting for inflation, that old $10 annual budget would cover more lights in a year than one could accumulate over seven years in the '80s. Today's cheaper lights, mostly made in China, also last longer.In our advanced economy -- in which innovation and competition are pushing the prices of goods ever lower and their quality ever higher -- it's more affordable than ever to make your house into a winter wonderland.Go ahead, light up your life.",0,1.0,0.0,3807

BEIJING--A preliminary gauge of China's manufacturing activity showed more weakness in June, which appeared to strengthen the case for more stimulus measures to spur growth.The HSBC initial, or ""flash,"" measure of manufacturing also foreshadowed weakness in the months ahead as its barometer of new manufacturing orders, particularly export orders, showed further declines amid a lingering global economic slowdown.China has already turned to an array of measures to boost growth, speeding up approvals on big projects, offering tax breaks and extending subsidies to promote consumer spending. A big unanswered question is whether the plethora of actions in the past month or so will be sufficient to boost growth during the second half of the year. If so, it could help strengthen global demand at a time when Europe is in recession and the U.S. is growing slowly.The HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.1 in June compared with a final reading of 48.4 in May. It was the eighth straight month of a reading below 50, which indicates contraction, though Qu Hongbin, HSBC chief economist for China, noted that the pace of slowdown had eased slightly.The drop was mainly driven by a further deterioration in new export orders, which fell by 2.6 points to 45.9 in June--the lowest reading since March 2009. Total new orders also slid to a seven-month low of 46.8 in June compared with 47.9 in May.

And the events of the past few weeks suggest that the current one may now be entering its last lap.That's not to say a recession is imminent. It doesn't seem to be. At the moment, the problem is not the economy's weakness but its unrelenting strength.Nevertheless, a certain dialectic has begun which, if history is any guide, will likely bring on a recession at some point in the not-too-distant future. The process may take six months, a year or even two years. But the unfortunate outcome will be difficult to escape.While the pattern has been emerging for some time, it became clear on Feb. 22, when the Labor Department announced that consumer prices rose at a 7.2% annual pace in January. Unlike other one-month price jumps in recent years, this one was spread over a surprisingly broad array of goods and services. The Federal Reserve responded with its most aggressive tightening move yet, pushing up short-term interest rates a half percentage point.This tug-of-war between the economy and the central bank is likely to continue, with signs of higher inflation being met with still-higher interest rates.

Americans have forgotten how to save in recent years.First, we came to regard the stock market as our piggy bank; if we needed a little spending money, surely we could always sell a few shares of stock or a bit of a mutual fund at a profit. Then, we viewed our houses as money machines that would always provide a surplus of cash on a moment's notice, since real estate ""never goes down in value.""All that has changed, at least for now. People finally have again realized how important it is to save. After all, thrift was once one of the quintessential American virtues: Just think of Benjamin Franklin intoning, ""A penny saved is a penny earned.""Our ancestors knew what we had forgotten until recently: Unless you save, you cannot make your wealth grow. It's much easier to tell ourselves that our horse will come in at the racetrack, or that we will win the lottery if we just keep playing 4-7-10-14-36-51, or that some stock we heard about online is the next Google, or that we can simply use our credit cards to buy whatever we feel like today and pay it all back tomorrow . . . after our horse comes in at the racetrack.But Benjamin Franklin was right when he wrote: ""Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day.""",0,0.6859999999999999,0.3140000000000001,2572

Sequenom Inc., a genomics-based biotechnology company, said it will acquire Gemini Genomics PLC of the United Kingdom in a stock swap valued at about $226.8 million, one of the first in what analysts expect to be a series of consolidations among genomics companies.The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects. Both companies also reaped tremendous rewards by making initial public offerings during the 2000 biotech stock-market boom -- and both have also seen their stock prices plummet since then.Sequenom, of San Diego, makes systems for sifting through genetic data in order to pinpoint meaningful genetic differences that might be linked to disease. Gemini, of Cambridge, England, has focused on amassing large databases of genetic data from twins, disease-affected families and participants in drug trials. The two companies struck a research partnership last June, one that has already produced tentative gene candidates linked to heart disease.Under the terms of the agreement, Gemini shareholders will receive 0.2 share of Sequenom in exchange for each share of Gemini stock.

On two issues this week, the Obama administration broke with and embraced the policies of his predecessor, drawing criticism on successive days from both ends of the political spectrum.The biggest break came with the decision Monday by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to initiate an investigation into allegations of detainee abuse by CIA interrogators and contractors.Obama, who in his first days as president ordered an end to the agency's harshest interrogation techniques, has said repeatedly that he does not wish to re-litigate the past or subject officials to criminal prosecution if they believed they were operating within parameters approved by their superiors. Holder's decision undercuts Obama's desire to move forward.The appointment of career prosecutor John H.

264,"Easing Inflation Could Help Bonds; Declining Oil Prices Reduce the Risk of Diminished Returns. Investors who rushed to the relative safety of bond funds when the stock market began to stagger last year might have thought they had outrun the troubles in equities -- only to face the new threat of inflation when oil prices started soaring. But with the cost of crude now falling, some fixed-income investors could find themselves in an enviable position.While economists and market watchers debate the reasons behind the drop that has left oil down more than $30 a barrel from its July 11 high of $147.27, most investors are probably simply relieved to see a pullback. In the case of bonds, lower prices for oil and other commodities can reduce the risks of inflation eating into returns. And if the decline in oil signals a slowing global economy rather than an overheated market taking a break, the sure-footedness of bonds could look even more attractive.Most investors find it easier to rely on bond funds rather than trying to navigate the complexities of the bond markets. A fund also will probably mean holdings are more safely spread out over a range of investments.Compared with the stock market, which has been pounded by the credit crisis, many types of bond funds have fared reasonably well over the past year. The credit problems have exacted a toll on riskier parts of the market, including the asset-backed debt that includes mortgages, car loans and credit cards.

In addition, economists say the increase was boosted by the federal government's temporary extension of unemployment benefits, which also padded incomes and savings.The feeble appetite of shoppers is one of several factors holding back the economic recovery. The stubborn unemployment rate and continued fallout in home prices have not only taken their own toll on the nation's financial health, but they also have consumers cautious, keeping their wallets in their pockets.A monthly survey by the University of Michigan/Reuters that was released Friday showed consumer sentiment dipped in September, dropping seven-tenths of a point on the index to 68.2.

CALGARY, Alberta -- Think Canadian natural gas will easily and cheaply cover a U.S. supply shortfall? Think again.With U.S. gas producers finding it tough to boost output, Americans are looking north to help satisfy demand. Canada supplies about 16% of the natural-gas consumed by its southern neighbor, up from 11% in 1995. But with its own productive capacity peaking, Canada isn't likely to provide a sustained fix for U.S. gas consumers, specialists here caution.That could lead to a supply crunch when a U.S. economic recovery takes hold. According to most analysts, U.S. demand for natural gas probably will expand steadily in the long term, due mainly to the fuel's increasing use in electricity generation, while domestic supply stays flat. Even in its latest short-term forecast for natural-gas demand -- revised to reflect economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic demand rebounding by 3.9% in 2002 after falling 2% this year.To address anticipated demand growth, U.S. energy companies have been snapping up natural-gas companies and assets in Canada, made cheaper by low natural-gas prices and the strong U.S. dollar.

In a country filled with yellow and orange terrorism alerts, fears of biological and chemical attacks, and pronounced discomfort with Muslims, Islam and the Koran, it would seem that there are certain untouchable topics that fashion has no business exploring.In the days and months following last year's terrorist attacks, which put an end to fashion week here, the industry responded much like the rest of the country -- with anger, shock and bold strokes of patriotism. With a harsh gravitas woven into daily life, the industry questioned once-prosaic decisions about putting camouflage, artfully wrecked garments or aggressive images on the runway. Designers softened their fashion show soundtracks. Or used no music at all. There was a greater awareness of how even the most modest examples of frivolity might be perceived in a world racked by grief and fear.For reasons of sensitivity and practicality, the fashion industry scaled back subsequent runway presentations, deciding that it would be inappropriate to condone shoving crowds, sharp tongues and prancing models on a set worthy of a Vegas showgirl. Designer boutiques opened without fanfare instead of popping champagne corks. Parties were downscaled to dinners.At the time, those seemed like the correct decisions. The business of fashion would carry on, but the silliness of it, the pretensions, the hype would be packed away for later consumption. All that anyone really wanted was the solace of beauty.The spring 2003 New York runway presentations begin today.

Meanwhile, Japan continued its net buying of Treasurys, hitting another record.Overall, foreigners were net buyers of long-term U.S. financial assets in January, according to the monthly Treasury International Capital report, known as TIC.TIC data showed China slimmed its net holdings by $5.4 billion to $1.155 trillion in January, following net selling of $4.0 billion in December and $11 billion in November. The biggest owner of U.S. debt hit a record $1.175 trillion of holdings of U.S. Treasury securities in October.

But in handling his first financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke shows signs of a break with Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman from 1987 to 2006.That shift is important in understanding why Mr. Bernanke hasn't cut the Fed's main interest rate yet, and it could alter investors' expectations of how the Bernanke Fed will function.The Fed historically has had two major economic duties. Maintaining financial stability is one. Controlling inflation while preventing recession is the other.To Mr. Greenspan, market confidence and the economy's growth prospects were so intertwined as to make the Fed's two duties almost inseparable. He cut rates after the 1987 stock-market crash and the near-collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 to prevent investor reluctance to take risks from undermining the nation's economic growth.By contrast, Mr. Bernanke distinguishes between the central bank's two functions.

HONG KONG -- The government's unprecedented intervention in the stock and futures markets here last week came ahead of financial and economic news, all of it expected to be bad, causing market participants to question assertions that the action was aimed only at battling speculators.The intervention, a retreat from the city's legendary commitment to free markets, is causing some politicians and investors to ask whether officials were aiding the interests of Hong Kong's corporate barons as the economy heads into deep recession.Many of the stocks purchased by the government in Friday's intervention were in companies controlled by big developers, many of them key constituent stocks of the blue-chip Hang Seng index. The government said its stock purchases were meant to reflect the broad market, and were aimed at hurting financial speculators who were selling stocks and futures as a way of pressuring the Hong Kong dollar lower. The Hong Kong currency is linked to the U.S. dollar, but some investors are trying to force Hong Kong to break that peg.The government's approach to last week's intervention has raised hackles. The government is led by Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping magnate who is close to the handful of powerful tycoons who control much of this city's wealth. His cabinet is a virtual plutocracy of senior business leaders, whose popularity has sagged along with the economy this year.

NEW YORK -- Bruce Kovner gave up on his Harvard Ph.D. because he couldn't get over writer's block on his doctoral thesis. He drove a cab. He studied the harpsichord. He tried political consulting. But in 1976, at age 31, he says, he was still ""floating"" through life.Finally, he decided he really needed to get a job and make some money. And did he ever: He earned about $100 million a year in 1989 and 1990, making him the highest paid trader on Wall Street. The assets he manages for his clients and himself have grown to $1.23 billion, which makes him one of the biggest independent traders of currencies and futures.This son of a trade unionist has become a friend of the rich and powerful. He chats up world policymakers as a trustee of four conservative think tanks, including the Hoover Institution and the American Enterprise Institute.

318,"Project Labor Revolt; The states ban union political bid-rigging. Obama demurs.. One benefit of the squeeze on state and local budgets is that politicians are finally having to confront their sweetheart deals with labor unions. The latest reform movement is moving against project labor agreements, or PLAs, that limit bids on construction projects to contractors that agree to union representation.Only about 13% of construction workers belong to unions, and PLAs are a union invention to use their political muscle to organize more companies. Proponents argue that PLAs ensure the speed and quality of construction plans. But PLAs are one of the reasons that Boston's Big Dig was estimated at $2.8 billion but eventually cost $22 billion. Studies show that projects under PLA contracts on average cost 12% to 18% more than projects awarded by open, competitive bidding. Taxpayers pick up much of this tab.The case of New York City is instructive. In 2009, the city's construction union and the association of builders agreed to an Economic Recovery Project Labor Agreement in the name of lowering costs and unfreezing construction halted during the recession. Some projects such as Frank Gehry's 76-story Beekman Tower did start, only to see costs skyrocket. According to the New York State Comptroller, wages have risen 12% city-wide, more than three times inflation. Contractors say strict union job classifications mean they have to employ superfluous workers. Many projects have frozen again, as PLA contracts expire and builders balk at new ones.In response to this evidence, states have been pulling away from PLAs. Louisiana passed a law this month that prohibits state entities from mandating the use of PLAs. Tennessee, Arizona and Idaho passed similar legislation earlier this year, and Iowa's Governor Terry Branstad, in one of his first acts after inauguration, signed an executive order ending a state PLA requirement. Legislatures in Maine and Michigan recently passed bills along these lines that governors are expected to sign. These states are joining Utah, Montana, Missouri and Arkansas, which enacted bans in recent years.The new wave of Republican state officials is leading this reform, but the public seems to support the effort even in Democratic-leaning areas. Seven localities in California have passed ballot initiatives to end mandated PLAs in the last decade, including five since 2009. This includes places like Chula Vista, where President Obama received 61% of the vote. As Andy Conlin of Associated Business and Contractors notes, wherever PLAs are subject to popular referendum, they're rejected.",0,1.0,0.0,3160

The expanding army of homeless, the increasing filth of our streets, tightening educational and police protection budgets, and the snowballing real price of medical care, higher education, performing arts, legal services and insurance are all inescapable realities of life. Every industrial country suffers from these symptoms to some degree, but, as in other fields, they are still a few years behind us.What has gone wrong and what, if anything, can be done? While no single cause can account for these complex problems, one influence explains a good deal, and suggests the way out.Productivity stagnation in the service industries has led to persistent rises in their costs. The laggard services include, most notably, health care, education, legal services, welfare programs for the poor, postal service, police protection, sanitation, repair services, the performing arts and restaurants. Their common element is the handicraft character of their production, requiring large labor inputs that are resistant to curtailment.There are at least two reasons why rapid and persistent productivity growth has eluded these stagnant services. First, some of them are inherently hard to standardize. Before one can cure a patient or repair a broken piece of machinery, it is necessary to determine, case by case, just what is wrong, and the treatment must then be tailored to the individual case.A second reason why it has been difficult to reduce the labor content of these services is that in many of them quality is, or is believed to be, inescapably correlated with the amount of labor expended on them. Teachers who cut down the time they spend on their classes or who increase class size, doctors who speed up the examination of patients, or a police force that spends less time on the beat, are all held to be shortchanging those whom they serve.",0,1.0,0.0,4065

AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalThe JNF was the first charity to buy American Airlines frequent-flier miles and offer donors one mile for every dollar contributed. Donors, by a ratio of 10 to 1, opted for miles over other incentives, including T-shirts and mugs. ""Everyone's a mileage junkie,"" says Stuart Paskow, a fund-raising consultant for the JNF, which helps develop land in Israel.Frequent-flier miles, dreamed up by American 15 years ago to sell airline tickets, have burgeoned into a national addiction -- and a significant new source of income that could help tide airlines over future recessions. The metamorphosis of mileage programs, to include charities and all manner of earth-bound goods and services, is giving airlines new influence in selling stuff having nothing to do with aviation.First, there were ""travel partners,"" such as hotels, car rentals and credit cards. Now, carriers are selling miles at two cents apiece to any company -- large or small -- that wants to offer them as sales incentives.

He suggested that short-term worries about the deficit will be eased as long as the economy is growing and pushing up government revenues.""The larger the {economic growth}, the more reasonable it is to stay with projected reduction targets"" for the federal deficit, Mr. Bush said in an interview. ""In other words, if you're making a lot of money you can owe a little more money.""Mr. Bush was dismissive of the National Economic Commission, a bipartisan panel that is studying ways to attack the deficit.

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has argued consistently in recent months that labor markets are abundant with slack that will hold inflation and wages down. But she hasn't convinced all her colleagues.Minutes of the Fed's April 29-30 policy meeting showed a lengthy debate on this subject and suggested labor-market slack will become an important battleground in the central bank's coming discussions about how long to continue its low-interest-rate policies.Many economists believe lots of slack in the labor market--large numbers of unemployed or underutilized workers--means the Fed can keep interest rates very low to help boost economic growth without generating high inflation. Conversely, they think that if there isn't much slack, or that it decreases rapidly, the central bank should raise rates more quickly to keep price pressures under control.The unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in April, not far from its long-run average of 5.8%. Ms. Yellen has argued other measures--such as the nation's many part-time workers who want full-time work--represent slack holding wages down. While that view is broadly held at the Fed, the minutes showed she faced some pushback at the last meeting.""Some participants reported that labor markets were tight in their districts or that contacts indicated some sectors or occupations were experiencing shortages of workers,"" the minutes said about the Fed's discussions, without identifying the participants by name or specifying the number holding certain views.",0,0.6779999999999999,0.3220000000000001,4084

For giant disk-drive maker Seagate Technology Inc., there has been no shortage of ripple effects from the economic crises coursing through Asia. The hard part has been figuring out whether the news is bad or good.Consider: In October, the world's biggest drive maker took a $63 million charge because of a badly timed hedging bet on the plunging currencies of Thailand and Malaysia, where Seagate has many of its plants. While the charge was a shock for shareholders, there was also an upside: The currency declines that triggered it also meant lower manufacturing costs for Seagate, the biggest private employer in those two countries.That bit of good news, though, was quickly offset by bad news in South Korea, where a weakening won gave Seagate's competitors like Samsung Group the chance to cut their prices. Panic time? Not so fast. Because of the same South Korean crisis, the likes of Samsung are facing a credit crunch that appears likely to curb their ability to expand operations. That's potentially a big plus for Seagate, because the company is struggling with an industrywide glut of disk drives. But a scarcity of credit is also bad news, of course, since consumers and corporations in South Korea and the rest of Asia will be buying fewer personal computers, in which most of Seagate's drives are used.Confused?

When it comes to creating a policy that will prove more effective in driving the economy forward, the official said, ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen.""But Mr. Kocherlakota stopped short in his speech of saying what he would like to see done. The official is currently a voting member of monetary-policy setting Federal Open Market Committee. At the FOMC's March meeting, he dissented against the committee's decision to stop providing numbers-based guidance about the potential timing of interest-rate rises.Ahead of last month's meetings, the Fed said it wouldn't consider increases in short-term rates until unemployment fell well past 6.5% as long as expected inflation stayed under 2.5%. A rapid and still hard-to-explain decline in unemployment--joblessness currently stands at 6.7%--drove the Fed to shift the way it describes its expected path for monetary policy. Now, the FOMC says rate increases are off the table until a broader and vaguer set of improvements are seen in the job market.Mr. Kocherlakota believed the change in the Fed's language weakened its commitment to push very weak levels of inflation back to the official target of 2%.

Some investors buy gold during times of geopolitical or economic uncertainty, believing the metal will hold its value better than other assets.By Monday, however, there was little evidence that the conflict would widen, as Kiev sought to play down the clash's significance, while Moscow called reports of the battle ""some kind of fantasy."" Western officials criticized the apparent incursion, but some played down the significance of the incident, noting that military equipment were believed to have been flowing over the border to pro-Russia separatists for months.Investors exited gold, which has been weighed down by worries of tightening monetary policy in the U.S. Higher interest rates are seen as a negative influence for gold, which costs money to hold and struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments. A stronger dollar and rising stocks also detracted from gold's appeal.",0,1.0,0.0,2747

Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Biogen Inc. announced yesterday that they would merge in a $6.8 billion deal that will create a powerhouse in the biotechnology industry, with the new company earning profits from two of the biggest biotech drugs on the market.It's the second-biggest biotech merger ever, after Amgen Inc.'s $10.8 billion acquisition of Immunex Corp. in 2002.To some degree, the deal reflects the extraordinary dependence of even the largest biotech companies on a handful of products.

The Federal Reserve is having trouble tying up the loose ends of its $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, prompting an announcement Monday that it would buy different bonds than planned.The Fed said it hasn't been able to complete the last $9.2 billion worth of deals to buy 5.5% 30-year bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because the debt is in such short supply. Instead, the Fed said it would buy other securities with lower nominal interest rates.The 5.5% notes are now so scarce that would-be sellers -- financial institutions called primary dealers -- are struggling to find enough of them to hand over to the Fed. Many are failing to deliver them.The Fed's dilemma shows just how tight the mortgage market has become -- fewer mortgages are being made, resulting in fewer mortgage-backed bonds being created. Tighter supply, however, has helped drive up prices by 3% to 4% on the 5.5 coupons securities; under the purchase agreements those gains belong to taxpayers.While the Fed ended its 15-month program to buy mortgage-backed securities at the end of March, several deals were designed to close this summer.

WASHINGTON -- A House tax panel intends to consider a bill to expand various taxpayer rights, including a measure aimed at curbing predatory ""tax refund anticipation"" loans.The House Ways and Means Committee is to consider today the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007. A description of the draft bill offers eight taxpayer-rights provisions, all of which have either no or negligible revenue effects, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.The item aimed at refund anticipation loans would prohibit the Treasury secretary from providing a ""debt indicator"" to tax preparers involved in preparing such loans with high fees or interest rates. Refund anticipation loans are short-term loans keyed to a person's pending tax refund. Consumers groups say many refund anticipation loans carry excessive interest rates.A debt indicator helps in the granting of refund anticipation loans because it tells whether a taxpayer has any offsetting debts to the federal government that could first be claims against a tax refund, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The debt indicator therefore reduces a lender's risk because it shows whether the government will seek to intercept part of the tax refund.The bill would prohibit the Treasury secretary from providing a debt indicator to any person involved in making refund anticipation loans with ""predatory"" charges and fees.",0,0.6774,0.3226,3202

By law, it can appeal the decision to the commission itself or in the federal court system.The FCC asked that a lump sum be paid after the pass-through issue is settled. The payment would be a major financial setback for Comsat, representing more than half of its $59 million in after-tax earnings in 1986. Sales that year were $467 million.",0,1.0,0.0,1188

KKR & Co.'s third-quarter profit surged more than 60%, buoyed by the increasing value of companies it owns and fees the buyout firm reaped from new deals it struck.KKR's third-quarter net income rose to $204.74 million, the buyout firm reported Thursday. So-called economic net income rose more than 20% to $613.75 million. Private-equity firms contend economic net income better reflects their performance because it gauges both realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments and factors in accounting quirks related to partnerships becoming public companies.The private-equity firm's economic net income after taxes amounted to 84 cents a adjusted unit, soundly beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 59 cents. In 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the buyout firm's shares rose 45 cents, or 2%, to $23.36.KKR's profits were largely the result of increases in the value of companies the firm bought and then partially sold in initial public offerings, including hospital operator HCA Holdings Inc. and NXP Semiconductors NV. The value of KKR's private-equity funds, which gather money from investors to buy companies, increased 5.9%.New York-based KKR's most-high-profile deal of the quarter, the takeover of industrial-pumps manufacturer Gardner Denver Inc., was a key contributor to its results in the quarter, as the buyout firm benefited by selling chunks of its equity in the $3.7 billion deal to other investors.

In addition to its direct contribution to the fund, the European Community, in its policy toward the single European market, has identified Ireland, North and South, as two of five priority regions in Europe for special aid. This need is reflected in substantial financial support for development programs in Ireland, North and South, during the next five years.With the demands that are now emergingUOand they should be supportedUOfor assistance for Eastern Europe, a fear has arisen that the European Community's assistance to Eastern Europe will be at the expense of the poorer regions of Western Europe.

Swaps in those days typically lasted no longer than two or three years. The trio envisioned deals lasting decades that would lock in profits and manage risks with unprecedented precision.

It was that this applause in fact had practically nothing to do with any such considerations, but was a function of something else: The members rose and roared, disrupted the speech with prolonged applause and otherwise loudly indicated their approval precisely and almost exclusively for those pronouncements that they knew to be untrue.Indeed, the more patently untrue, the lustier and more protracted the cheer. The fundamental proposition was always the same: that we could have it all - a stronger defense and more investment in domestic programs, environmental purity and accelerated energy development, lower taxes and increased benefits, etc. We will do this, but not at the expense of that ... the speaker would intone, his voice rising to indicate deep conviction for the wholly implausible second part of the sentence.

Yes, there were some muzzy, unpersuasive moments. But in the main Clinton was saying not that we could have it all, but that we couldn't and that we now had to choose how to get out of the economic predicament that had been talked about mostly by indirection or even covertly in Washington for years.Over those years, the dialogue on the question of the budget deficit and its effect had become ever more tortured, demeaning and involuted - embarrassingly so, I would have thought, for grown men and women. We at The Washington Post, starting back in the early Reagan years, would occasionally be visited (""off the record"") by prominent Republican legislators and others urging us editorially to help bring about some bipartisan deal wherein big shots of both parties would just sort of close their eyes, hold hands and jump off the cliff together, always with careful provisions to keep one of the parties from cheating and being left standing there on the ledge while the other - poor fool - plummeted into the political abyss. They would talk about ways to frame the thing so that Reagan more or less wouldn't notice or at least wouldn't have the wit to object. They discussed him as if he were the mad uncle in the attic who, unfortunately, still had title to the house.It was unbelievable, now that I think of it, but at the time it seemed only mildly strange. That is because Washington had pretty thoroughly bought into the proposition that some of the things Bill Clinton was to say the other night simply could not be said, not even argued about - too dangerous. People outside this city who complain about the waste of taxpayers' money should, if they want to get even madder, merely contemplate how much they paid out in both executive and legislative branch salaries over the decades to people who gave over hours and days and weeks of paid time to fussing about who would or wouldn't get the blame for saying aloud what they were all whispering among themselves.",0,1.0,0.0,2202

NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's abrupt credit easing and the dollar's sharp fall will help avert a recession next year, according to many economists and investment managers. But they also predict that inflation and interest rates will rebound next year.Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, interest rates have tumbled more than 1 1/2 percentage points as the Federal Reserve suddenly opened the monetary spigot in an effort to calm the financial markets. Last week, the Reagan administration emphasized that its top priority is to prevent a recession, even if that means a lower dollar.These policies may only provide ""a respite"" for the credit markets, says John Paulus, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co. ""This is a strategy to avoid serious action on (cutting) the budget deficit while liquifying our way past a recession. The Republicans are whistling past the graveyard by doing nothing.""Radford Rigsby, a portfolio manager for the Harvard Management Co., says he is ""very cynical"" about the recent bond market rally and remains concerned about the long-term inflation outlook. Although the dollar already has declined as much as 7% against most major currencies during the past three weeks, ""we may have to wait until the end of 1988 before we see a big rise in inflation,"" he says.""I own a lot of bonds right now, but I'm not sure how much longer I'll hold on.

""Move-up"" buyers are moving back into the housing market.As the high interest rates that long locked them in their old homes eased this spring, homeowners who want bigger or fancier dwellings became a major factor in real-estate sales. It has been five years since such buyers have been in the market so deeply, experts say, and the trend appears likely to persist -- fueled by pent-up demand among affluent baby boomers and stable mortgage rates.""We're clearly past the bulge as far as the . . . first-time buyer being the dominant element in housing,"" says Weston Edwards, a senior executive vice president of Lomas & Nettleson, the nation's biggest mortgage banker. Now, he says, ""we're beginning to see their move-up process.""The return of move-up buyers could reshape the housing industry. Their moves will increase the supply of more modest homes for sale, which could depress their prices. To meet demand for higher-priced homes, builders may shift away from their emphasis on small starter houses. In wealthier suburbs, housing experts expect builders to construct more expensive, custom-built homes. And since people buying higher-priced homes tend to also want lots of amenities, the building-supply industry hopes to benefit too.The presence of these buyers is showing up in the robust figures on new- and existing-home sales. In May, for example, newhome sales rose 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted 676,000-unit annual pace, a level expected to continue throughout 1985.

The government thinks the field-development deals it has handed out to international companies are on the way to boosting output significantly. With Iraq depending on oil exports for some 90% of its government revenue, that is expected to provide a broader boost to an economy that is already benefiting from high growth and tame inflation.No one is predicting an economic miracle in Iraq, which is still smarting from decades of sanctions, underinvestment and a creaky, centrally planned economy. Unemployment remains high, posing a continued risk that jobless youth will be lured to the insurgency. Power outages are common, leaving residents sweltering in darkness and complaining at times that things were better before the invasion.The Bush administration denied going to war over oil.

His followers were congressmen like George McGovern, Stewart Udall and James Roosevelt.To compare the informal Marauders to the formal House organization that in 1959 would grow out of their plotting, the Democratic Study Group, is to compare a guerrilla band to a mechanized infantry division. Today's DSG has an operating budget of more than $700,000. It has offices, researchers -- and an impressive record of spearheading liberal fights.

Facing unprecedented inflation, panic buying and social discontent, Communist Party leaders have retreated from proposals for an immediate, radical transformation of China's centrally controlled pricing system.Meeting at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, the party's ruling Politburo has approved a compromise draft document on reforming the system of prices and wages, effectively postponing difficult decisions on the issue.China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, had been pressing for price reform-seen by some Chinese as the key to the success of all other economic reforms implemented in the last 10 years-that would go far beyond any measures previously attempted by a communist country. But instead the leaders adopted a more cautious, step-by-step approach.The aim of price reform is to allow most prices to reflect true production costs, thus increasing efficiency in systems dominated by arbitrarily set prices and subsidies. China's reform program has been aimed at restructuring its rigidly planned, Soviet-style economic system to one receptive to market forces.Price reform is supposed to make it possible to determine profits and losses with greater accuracy and eliminate the widespread corruption in the country's two-tier system of state-set and floating prices. This results in part from profiteers, who, with the assistance of certain party officials, buy commodities at low, state-set prices and then sell them at higher prices on the free market.",0,0.6855,0.3145,5

Two years ago, the last time the question was asked, Americans were more even-lySdivided, with 44 percent saying Reagan would do the better job and 42 percent saying the Democrats could._The findings run counter to recent claims from the White House and Republican strategists that Reagan is more highly regarded than the Democrats on handling the deficit. The president has recently returned to the deficit issue as a political tactic, launching a new round of attacks blaming Congress for the red ink.The survey shows that Americans by a narrow margin assign more blame to Reagan than to Congress for the deficit, expected to be about $170 billion this year. Of those questioned, 45 percent said thfey blame Reagan for the deficits, compared with 41 percent for Congress. This is a marked change from earlier in ReaganUas presidency when the poll indicated that Congress was blamed more widely than the president for the deficits.In the new survey, Americans said by a 2-to-l ratio that they disapprove of ReaganUas handling of the deficit.

Investors may be talking bearish, but they're still walking bullish.During the past two months, the level of negative sentiment -- at least as articulated by the assorted seers and chin-scratchers on Wall Street -- has grown noticeably. Strategists bullish throughout 1995's impressive stock market run have grown increasingly skittish about the market's prospects for the rest of this year. Among the reasons bearishness is so in vogue: speculative movement among small stocks and an overly aggressive investor lust for initial public offerings of any kind.But at the same time, even as the talk grows more pessimistic, the folks with the hard cash continue to remain, well, fairly bullish. Mutual fund cash inflows are powerfully strong. Cash levels among institutional investors are stuck at aggressively low levels. Money managers, while nervously talking about rising interest rates and stretched valuations, continue to deploy new assets into the stock market. And analysts' estimates for 1996 earnings for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index companies have risen in four of the past five weeks, according to I/B/E/S International Inc., a research firm in New York.""People are talking a lot about being more nervous, but I sure don't see it reflected in the stock prices,"" says Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. ""Part of the problem is that people are afraid of being out of the market. Though investors are talking more pessimistically, the one thing we've learned during the past year and a half is that being in cash is not the place to be.""Yes, holding cash can be deadly, which might explain why it's easier to try to call a market top than it is to move investments to reflect such sentiment.

The Food and Drug Administration last night approved a long- awaited drug for a form of viral hepatitis, expanding treatment options for a disease that afflicts more than 1 million Americans.The action was a significant boost for Gilead Sciences Inc., a Foster City, Calif., biotechnology company that has built a strong portfolio of antiviral drugs. Gilead already sells one of the country's fastest-growing AIDS treatments, and analysts have said the new hepatitis B drug, known as Hepsera or adefovir dipivoxil, could bring revenue of $200 million a year or more.Hepatitis is a slow-to-develop but life-threatening ailment that can lead to cancer or catastrophic liver failure. Many liver doctors had been awaiting the action the FDA took last night. Unsatisfied with two drugs already on the market, which have severe limitations, the doctors held off treatment for many patients healthy enough to wait. They also had been seeking a new treatment for seriously ill patients who have exhausted all other options.""It works dramatically"" in many patients for whom another antiviral drug, lamviudine, has stopped working, said Eugene Schiff, head of the Center for Liver Diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine and a consultant to Gilead. ""It's not a perfect drug, but there's no question it's an advance in hepatitis B.""The new drug is one of a growing number of spinoffs from the nation's investment in AIDS research. It was originally developed as an AIDS drug but proved too toxic in that use and was turned down by the FDA. However, it proved effective against the hepatitis B virus at far lower, and therefore safer, doses. It works by blocking reproduction of the virus.",0,1.0,0.0,5094

Trailing in the polls with election day just four months away, Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a much-needed boost today from President Clinton, who heaped praise on Europe's longest-serving leader during a tour that had all the appearances of a political campaign.After celebrating one of the defining moments of the Cold War by marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, at Tempelhof Airport, Clinton escorted Kohl aboard Air Force One for a short flight to Eisenach, a town in the former Communist part of eastern Germany where they toured a modern car plant built by General Motors Corp.Clinton's visit was the first by a U.S. president to eastern Germany, and it was welcomed by Kohl, who lags far behind his Social Democratic rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls.Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990. ""Thanks in no small measure to the leadership of your chancellor, Germany today is one nation, in harmony with its neighbors,"" Clinton told a packed town square, as a beaming Kohl reveled in the praise of his foreign guest.During a foreign policy address Wednesday at Berlin's Schauspielhaus, a famous opera house located on what was once the Communist side of the Berlin Wall, Clinton extolled Kohl's record as chancellor for the past 16 years in terms that sounded like either an endorsement or a political eulogy.",0,1.0,0.0,1448

At the other extreme, invest completely in safer but lower-yielding investments, and you may be earning less than with a more diversified portfolio.But you also need to spread your risks within each asset category.

437,"Bookshelf: Expanding the Pie: A New Public Philosophy. Political discourse in modern America usually proceeds on one of two levels -- either slogans (""It's Morning in America""), or specific policies (individual retraining accounts). The vast area between, where slogans are connected to policies and policies are linked to one another, is often the most important but the least discussed. Here is forged a public philosophy.Since the end of the Great Society, conservative Republicans have busily been seeding this value-laden terrain. Through countless articles, books, academic studies and conferences, they have concocted a relatively coherent public philosophy. Liberal Democrats, by contrast, have had an abundance of slogans and detailed programs, but they have tended in recent years to ignore the normative vision lying between. As a result, their public philosophy has seemed muddled. This has cost them dearly.Robert Lekachman, a professor of economics at City University of New York, understands the importance of a coherent public philosophy and worries that liberals have lost their way. In his ""Visions and Nightmares: America After Reagan"" (Macmillan, 316 pages, $19.95), he sets out the central challenge for America's left -- to articulate principles of equity and social justice, ""and appeal to passions of morality and patriotism that avoid the chauvinism and intrusions into lifestyles of the political right.""Mr. Lekachman has two recurring nightmares about American society after Ronald Reagan. The first is that America will slip into a deeper and more prolonged neoconservativism. It will feature the privatization of public services and its corollary, the substitution of vouchers for publicly funded services; the destruction of labor unions and thus a continued downward drift in real wages; in consequence of both, an increasing gulf between the rich and the poor; an enlarged and engorged military; and so on.Mr. Lekachman's other nightmare is that ""neoliberals"" will be in charge. He defines them (along with your reviewer) as people who, in contrast to conventional liberals, believe in market solutions and assume social harmony. ""For them, politics seems less group conflict than the search for tax, regulatory, and mild planning initiatives that promote enough growth to soften the harsh edges of ancient struggles between rich and poor, black and white, males and females, the sunbelt and the rust belt.""

The Reagan administration, in its first major statement on monetary policy, yesterday urged the Federal Reserve Board to stop paying attention to the level of interest rates and begin concentrating on one rather than several measures of the money supply. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkle advised the Fed to allow its discount rate to vary more freely with market rates.Sprinkel gave detailed technical advice to Fed Chairman Paul Volcker on how to achieve the steadier, slower money growth which both Reagan officials and the Fed support. The FedUas offical response yesterday was UIno comment.USprinkel emphasised in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee that the Fed was an independent agency, and that the administration did not want to change that. Over the last few months the Fed has done a good job of conducting monetary policy he said.

Therefore she was immediately Elizabeth II, sovereign.Tony Blair, the 10th prime minister of Elizabeth II's reign, was not yet born when she ascended to the throne. Winston Churchill was then the first among her ministers. How much has changed since her June 1953 coronation? The decision to televise it was deeply controversial. Most television sets were in pubs, where, it was feared, decorum among the lower orders might lapse during the ceremony.Since then, the House of Windsor, including some of its much-too- merry wives, has often resembled a soap opera. But, then, sovereignty has never been a shield from life's vicissitudes: The longest- surviving child of Queen Anne's (1702-14) 18 pregnancies died at age 11.Elizabeth II's coronation coincided with Edmund Hillary's conquest of Everest (and, almost as inspiriting, with the end of tea rationing, a relic of the war), which stirred hopes of a ""New Elizabethan Age."" Instead, there was the continuing loss of empire, a diminishing world role, watery socialism and worsening economic anemia. By the mid-1970s Britain was reduced to the status of the sick man of Europe. Then came revival, but the woman who authored it was named not Elizabeth but Margaret -- Thatcher.Once upon a time, in mankind's political immaturity, monarchy was the best available answer to the problems of sovereignty and succession as nation-states evolved.

449,"Don't Blame Capitalism. Amid the chaos of recent days, as the federal government has taken gargantuan steps to stabilize the financial markets, realigning the U.S. economic system in the process, comes a nearly universal consensus: This crisis resulted from government reluctance to regulate the unbridled greed of Wall Street. Many economists and market participants who were formerly averse to government interference agree that a more robust regulatory framework must be constructed to cage the destructive forces of capitalism.For the political left, which has long championed the need for such limits, this crisis is the opportunity of a lifetime.Absent from such conclusions is the central role the government played in creating the crisis. Yes, many Wall Street leaders were irresponsible, and they should pay. But they were playing the distorted hand dealt them by government policies. Our leaders irrationally promoted home-buying, discouraged savings, and recklessly encouraged borrowing and lending, which together undermined our markets.Just as prices in a free market are set by supply and demand, financial and real estate markets are governed by the opposing tension between greed and fear. Everyone wants to make money, but everyone is also afraid of losing what he has. Although few would ascribe their desire for prosperity to greed, it is simply a rose by another name. Greed is the elemental motivation for the economic risk-taking and hard work that are essential to a vibrant economy.But over the past generation, government has removed the necessary counterbalance of fear from the equation. Policies enacted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which were always government entities in disguise), and others created advantages for home-buying and selling and removed disincentives for lending and borrowing. The result was a credit and real estate bubble that could only grow -- until it could grow no more.",0,1.0,0.0,2667
450,"The Evening Wrap: Immobilized. The Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, but it was hardly out of complacency.Caught between heightened inflation fears and persistent concerns about a sluggish economy, Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers decided to leave the Fed's key short-term interest rate unchanged at 2%. The non-move marked the end of a series of rate cuts dating back to last summer, when credit woes were creeping up on the economy. The latest vote was 9-1, with Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, once again dissenting, this time opting for a rate increase. And, indeed, recent comments from Fed personages -- including Wednesday's commentary -- suggest the bank's next rate move will be upward. ""Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased,"" the Fed said in its statement. The bank is in a bit of a pickle. Reporter Sudeep Reddy writes that Fed officials are trying to avoid rate increases for now to avoid exacerbating the weakness in employment, financial markets and the housing sector. At the same time, they are trying to signal they're serious about fighting inflation by talking about the risks of rising inflation expectations and suggesting a willingness to act quickly if inflation expectations get out of hand. Assuming commodity prices don't go completely haywire, some economists think that won't happen, as the weakening economy, particularly the rising unemployment rate, restrain wages and a willingness to spend. Indeed, Joseph Brusuelas of Merk Investments thinks a rate increase won't be happening anytime soon. ""We anticipate that the rate hike currently priced in [by markets] for September will wither away in the heat of the summer slowdown in the economy,"" he said. Likewise, PNC economist Stuart Hoffman, while now more convinced that the Fed's next move will be an increase, sees the federal-funds rate holding at 2% until ""late 2008 or early 2009.""---Stocks Inch UpThe Federal Reserve's announcement gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average a quick boost, but in the end the blue-chip gauge was ahead only 4.40 points, or 0.04%, at 11811.83.

As both the U.S. and European Union struggle to conjure the right combination of fiscal and monetary tools to rein in deficits while boosting economic growth, they risk overlooking trade policy. If the two powers want a noninflationary way to inject more dynamism into their economies, there is one quick step they could take: agree to eliminate all tariffs in trans-Atlantic trade.While tariffs are already low between the U.S. and the EU, the enormous size of their economic relationship -- $600 billion in trade and $2 trillion invested by companies in each other's markets every year -- means that even small steps could yield significant gains in prosperity.According to a report by the Brussels-based European Center for International Political Economy, a trans-Atlantic zero-tariffs initiative would increase combined U.S.-EU gross domestic product by $180 billion within five years. That's more added growth than either would receive from the completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks. And while Doha is facing serious obstacles to its completion, a ""Trans-Atlantic Zero"" deal could be signed quickly. The issues that have held up bilateral trade pacts in the past -- social, labor and environmental standards -- should not matter between the U.S. and EU, which share roughly similar ways of organizing their societies.Since one-third of trans-Atlantic trade occurs between branches of the same firm, eliminating tariffs on that trade would cut costs for both American and European companies and make them more competitive in global markets. That could help trans-Atlantic firms respond to the rise of Chinese, Indian, Brazilian and other emerging-market firms without resorting to protectionist measures.Whatever other policies emerge from Brussels and Washington, trade liberalization can only add to the economic potential of America and Europe.

Employment rose by 470,000 jobs, or 6.5%, the seventh-best gain.

Florida lost roughly 825,000 jobs during Mr. Crist's four years as governor ending in 2011, primarily due to the worst global economic downturn in a generation. The state also grappled with a $3.6 billion budget shortfall the year Mr. Crist left office.Mr. Scott faces a quandary similar to that facing many Republican governors seeking re-election this year after arguing that austerity steps would boost their states: The economy is improving, but many voters remain gloomy about the future.

Welch Jr. and well-regarded politicians such as Vice President Gore embrace it as the key to making all organizations work.Yet just as it has reached a level of near universal acceptance in American offices, the performance review - the annual evaluation of an employee's strengths and weaknesses - is encountering a backlash from the ranks of the industrial psychologists and efficiency experts who once considered it indispensable.The performance review has spread so far in the 1980s and early 1990s that it is now the rare employee who has not fidgeted in his chair while hearing or reading his working life picked apart. Gore has enshrined the management device by dubbing his effort to reinvent government the National Performance Review, and making improved employee evaluations a key part of it. Corporate leaders are promising to revolutionize the workplace by bringing computers and customers into the performance review process.And yet with all this riding on performance reviews, management consultants and psychologists have concluded that the reviews have severe shortcomings. Detailed studies of performance appraisals show that at their best they often are wildly inconsistent and damaging to the loyalty and commitment that help employees do their best.",0,1.0,0.0,3522

WORCESTER, Mass. -- For years, bankruptcy lawyer Paul Daley jokingly advised his Boston clients to ""get a phone booth in Worcester"" if they ever had to seek protection from creditors.That way, they would have an address here and be able to file through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, before Judge James F. Queenan Jr., a man whose reputation for debtor-friendly decisions has helped to draw cases from Boston and even other states. During the recession-induced bankruptcy boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Judge Queenan's court served as Chapter 11 Heaven, and since he was the only bankruptcy judge sitting in the western district of Massachusetts, petitioners who filed in Worcester had 100% certainty of drawing him.Then came Judge Henry J. Boroff.

Pete Wilson (R) said today his state would have to make drastic cuts in spending because of a $3 billion budget shortfall.In an interview, Wilson said that record budget cuts and tax increases approved by the Legislature three months ago in an attempt to close the largest budget deficit of any state had proved insufficient. He said the Legislature would ""have to make some very unpleasant choices"" and hinted he would try again to win approval of cuts in education spending that both parties refused to consider this year.New economic figures released by the California Commission on Finance show that the state remains mired in recession, with the loss of 380,000 jobs already this year, and cast new doubts on White House optimism that the nation is emerging from the recession.California, with nearly one of eight of the nation's jobs, is often an economic barometer. The state's economy would be the seventh largest in the world if California were a nation. And because state officials closely monitor economic conditions, California often gives early warning of national trends.What these trends showed in the finance commission's report was a drop of $344 million in tax collections during July, August and September.

485,"Children's Education Is a Smart Investment. Early childhood development may seem like an odd topic for a Federal Reserve Bank president. But as a regional Reserve Bank in a federated central banking system like the Fed, we spend a good deal of time trying to understand the economies that make up our district, which includes Maryland, D.C., Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas.Data on the growth of income per person across the United States and across cities and metropolitan areas reveal that at least one important measure of skills is consistently correlated with future growth. That measure is education, and a typical finding is that the share of the population of a U.S. city or state that had a college degree in 1990 was positively associated with growth in family income between 1990 and 2000. In other words, the more educated the population, the greater the subsequent growth in economic well-being. Furthermore, population growth is correlated with education levels, suggesting that places with highly skilled populations create opportunities that attract newcomers.What is striking about the empirical evidence is that higher skill levels predict faster growth, all else equal. One possible interpretation of this fact is that skills, in addition to boosting current income, enhance an area's ability to further build its skill base: ""Human capital begets more human capital,"" you might say. Economists have identified two distinct ways this might come about. One is the straightforward notion that certain general skills make people better at learning new skills. Another involves what economists call ""externalities"" or ""increasing returns,"" meaning that a skilled worker is more productive in a marketplace or work environment with other skilled workers.The idea that human capital promotes growth is, perhaps, not too surprising. After all, and as I mentioned, it's quite natural to think of differences in skills as explaining a substantial part of the differences in income between individuals -- why shouldn't this logic extend to communities, cities, states and so on? At the level of individual workers, in fact, there is abundant evidence that the importance of skill to one's economic well-being has grown over the last several decades. This is seen in a growing gap between the average wages earned by high school graduates and those with college or advanced degrees.The growth in this pay differential, or ""skill premium,"" is a major factor behind the increase in income inequality that has received so much attention of late. The apparent reasons for this widening dispersion are germane here. Wages paid to workers at any particular skill level generally reflect the productivity of those workers -- how much economic value their work creates. If the wages of higher-skilled workers have grown more rapidly than the wages of the less-skilled, it must be that the work environment has changed in a way that has made the productivity of higher-skilled workers rise more rapidly.",0,1.0,0.0,578
486,"Price Index Change Will Trim Inflation Rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the latest in a series of small changes in its measurement of consumer prices that will lop 0.1 percentage point off the nation's annual inflation rate.Arcane details of how the consumer price index is constructed have become politically sensitive because of their potential impact on the federal budget. Because the CPI is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments in a number of major federal benefit programs such as Social Security, any overstatement of inflation raises spending. At the same time, because the CPI is used to adjust for inflation the personal income tax brackets and the size of the personal exemption, it also influences revenue.Fixing what the statisticians call ""formula bias"" will save the government roughly $2 billion in the first year, with the annual savings growing over time. The Clinton administration had estimated that this change would save 0.2 percentage point, taking the middle range of the BLS's earlier estimate of change, and used that higher figure in its latest budget projections. Because the change is kicking in six months earlier than planned -- it will start with the figures released in July -- the administration's estimate for 1997's budget isn't much affected.However, the difference between a 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point reduction means the budget deficit would be about $5 billion higher in 2002 if no offsetting actions were taken, an administration official said.The fix announced by the BLS focuses on a glitch in compiling the CPI that was discovered by BLS researchers two years ago. The problem arises when an item happens to be on sale when it is included in the CPI for the first time. When its price returns to the usual level, it gives an unwarranted boost to the index.",0,0.6716,0.3284,1340

The average had lost 7.71 percent of its value since its peak on Aug. 6 at 8259.31.But analysts said it was too soon to say if today's action signaled the beginning of a new leg up for the bull market. Rather, several analysts expect big-company stocks to hover in a narrow trading range, at least until economists get a better fix on whether Federal Reserve Board policymakers will decide to raise short-term interest rates when they meet on Sept. 30.",0,1.0,0.0,2090

The downgrades signal that interest rates will increase on about $3 billion in commercial paper, according to credit experts.The downgrades by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services sent Lockheed Martin shares down $1.50 to close at $18.5625 in New York Stock Exchange 4 p.m. trading. The stock has dropped from a 52-week high of about $56.75, as a series of management and program problems have emerged in the past year.Some of the new ratings are at the lowest possible level in the ""investment-grade"" category. The drops stem from a Lockheed Martin forecast last week indicating that year-2000 cash flow will drop to less than $500 million from about $900 million estimated in late September. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., also said its year-2000 earnings are likely to be about $1 a share, instead of the $2.15 a share forecast in late September.Lockheed Martin has faced serious production and sales problems in certain of its units making satellites, rockets and some military aircraft.Wall Street experts said the most dramatic effect of the credit-agency downgrades would be the increased interest rates applied to the $3 billion or so of commercial paper the company has used for short-term borrowing. The paper typically features a variable interest rate. Another effect could be to trigger further sales of the stock by institutional holders.

493,"Fed Officials See Gradual Exit Strategy, Minutes Show. Federal Reserve officials laid out a broad blueprint for very gradually tightening financial conditions when the economy is healthy enough to bear it.Minutes of the Fed's April 26-27 meeting, released Wednesday with the normal three-week lag, showed Fed officials had an extensive discussion about what is known as their exit strategy from an era of easy credit. But the Federal Open Market Committee minutes noted the discussion didn't mean that any moves ""would necessarily begin soon."" Many analysts believe it could take months or even years for the Fed to start raising interest rates.In normal times this wouldn't require much debate. The Fed would simply raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, to tighten credit, slow growth and pull back inflation. Because of the unusual steps it took during and after the financial crisis, its exit from easy-money policies this time around will be more complicated. It must substantially reduce a $2.4 trillion portfolio of mortgage and Treasury securities.The first step, as Fed chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in a first-ever news conference following the April meeting, will be a decision to allow the mortgage portfolio to start shrinking on its own--by allowing the securities to mature without reinvesting the proceeds in Treasurys, as it has been doing.At the same time or shortly thereafter it will do the same thing with some of its long-term Treasury bonds. At some point, the Fed will slowly and steadily sell its mortgage holdings. Officials were inclined to hold off on active securities sales until after they had taken other steps, including raising the short-term fed funds rate, the minutes showed.",0,0.6937,0.3063,801
494,"Integrity in Numbers. Federal statistics are the guide by which the government',steers the massive economic and social policies that touch the^lives of us all. These statistics are very sensitive. The monthly reports on inflation, for example, are calculated in tenths of a percentage point. A few tenths of a point, up or down, are a disaster or a triumph for the administration. A few more tenths of a point can turn an election.Professional scholars and analysts have been expressing rising concern over political pressures on the agencies that gather and compute these crucial figures. Their concern rose sharply this spring when the administration picked men from President NixonUas re-election campaign operations to head two of the most prestigious statistical agencies. Last Tuesday we denounced these appointments, and this morning we publish a letter in reply from Paul R. Squires, the associate director of one of those agencies, the Census Bureau. Mr. Squires correctly points out a factual error in our editorial Tuesday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is, of course, in the Department of Labor and not. as we erroneously said, in the Department of Commerce. Otherwise, unfortunately, our comments on Tuesday were accurate. If anything, we have come to this issue a bit late.Last December, the Industrial Relations Research Association published a resolution declaring that UIthe credibility of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been impaired by events of the last two years.U Those events had just culminated in the White HouseUas decision to fire the highly qualified head of the Bureau, Dr. Geoffrey Moore. Five months later, the job still has not been filled.The American Statistical Association and the Federal Statistics UsersUa Conference set up a point Committee on the Integrity of Federal Statistics that, after a yearUas study, brought out its report in February. UIThe causes for concern which led to the formation of this committee have been intensified during the past year,U it declared. It spoke of UIpremature retirements of key professional personnel,U and a reorganization pattern that UIprovides increasing opportunities to exert political influence on the development and interpretation of statistical programs.UWhat could political pressure accomplish? Certainly nothing so obvious as falsified figures. But this committee report offers an illustration of the danger. Suppose that an automobile manufacturer adds pollution control equipment to its cars and raises the price. Does the price increase represent an improvement in the quality of the car? All of the price .increase? Part of it? If it is counted as a quality improvement, then it shows up in the statistics as growth in real economic production, wealth, and manpower productivity. If it is counted as a cost increase, it shows up as more inflation. In that case, it could trigger cost-Qf-living raises for millions of workers, and strengthen the political criticism of the administrationUas economic strategy;",0,0.6593,0.3407,1290

The latest news about the U.S. economy is so good -- in terms of low unemployment, rebounding growth, falling inflation, declining interest rates and record stock prices -- that private analysts and government policymakers alike are cheering.Yesterday, the Labor Department added to the good news by reporting that August producer prices for finished goods fell 0.1 percent after three other similarly good months. Federal Reserve officials said the report indicates that last winter's inflation bubble, which could have derailed the economic expansion had it spread, has now burst.Both the stock and bond markets rallied on the inflation news, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rising 42.27 points to close at a record 4747.21.Bond prices also jumped, as interest rates on 30-year U.S. government bonds declined by nearly a tenth of a percentage point to 6.50 percent.

WASHINGTON--The Federal Reserve said Thursday that banks will have a full two years to bring their activities in line with the so-called Volcker rule before regulators start enforcing it, a formal statement aimed at calming bank fears that they would be forced to act before a July deadline.The Fed and other banking regulators said banks will have until July 21, 2014, ""to conform all of their activities and investments"" to the Volcker rule, which restricts U.S. banks from trading with their own money.""During the conformance period, banking entities should engage in good-faith planning efforts"" to make sure they are in line with the restrictions no later than that date, the Fed said.At issue is a legal worry raised by the fact that regulators are unlikely to have their final regulation implementing the Volcker rule by the July deadline set out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. The provision is set to take effect on July 21, whether or not regulators have the details hammered out by then. That raised a concern among some banks and their lawyers that banks might need to change some activities ahead of the final rule in order to not violate the law.The Fed clarified that banks will have a full two years from the July deadline before regulators will enforce any aspect of the rule.

Take this monthUas Post-ABC News poll. It shows, for example, that only 22 percent favor defense spending increases, while even fewerUOfrom 4 to 20 percentUOsupport cuts in domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and student loans. Since the presidentUas budget increases defense and cuts the latter, you might conclude that the voters are solidly against it.But there is something to the argument, usually made by administration acolytes, that voters are using Mr. ReaganUas programs as a baseline. They understand that defense has gone up a lot in the Reagan years, and, happy with that, see no need for it to go up much more; they have the sense that domestic spending has been cut, and are cautious about cutting it further. And certainly they come out on Mr. ReaganUas side on tax increases. By a 68-to-30-percent margin, they agree that taxes should not be increased to cut the deficit.Even granting all that, however, the poll does not support the White House position that the people really support the presidentUas budget, even if the politicians donUat. Mr. ReaganUas operatives are quick to argue that weli-connected lobbyists and well-positioned congressmen have kept in place many programs that the public generally doesnUat particularly want and for whose continued existence there are only the flimsiest of arguments.

But saying that white-collar federal employees will receive an average raise of a certain amount tells only part of the story, and numerous employees have asked for a primer on pay.A: There are two components to General Schedule raises--the across- the-board part and the portion divided up as locality pay. For 2001, 2.7 percentage points of the raise will go to the former and 1 percentage point to the latter.The government divides the funds available for locality pay among 32 designated localities based on how they rank in terms of pay gaps with local private-sector salaries. The calculation produced a 3.81 percent raise for the Washington-Baltimore locality for 2001.Although many Washington area employees believe the region gets (or should get) one of the biggest portions of the annual locality payout, it actually ranks in the middle of the pack among localities. Employees in the San Francisco area get the most. For example, the annual salary this year for a GS-15, step 1, is $89,264 in San Francisco, compared with $84,638 in Washington and $82,876 in the lowest-paid locality designation, the catchall ""rest of the United States,"" for employees outside the selected metropolitan areas.The distribution of locality pay is based on local wage markets, not on local living costs.

Following her broker's advice, Cecilia Walsh put her entire $375,000 divorce settlement into auction-rate securities last December, planning on using the money for her day-to-day needs.Yet before she ever withdrew a penny from the account, the auction- rate-debt market froze up, and Ms. Walsh, a 47-year-old actor in Delray Beach, Fla., was unable to withdraw any of her money. Her broker, UBS AG, gave her a margin loan secured by her account so that Ms. Walsh could pay her living expenses. But UBS later marked down the value of the securities in her account and has demanded that she repay part of the loan.In the four months since auction-rate securities stopped trading normally, investors like Ms. Walsh have been taking out loans, selling their securities at big discounts, filing arbitration cases against their brokers, or simply waiting and hoping that the market will start functioning again. The one thing they haven't found is an easy way to get their money back.For decades, individuals and companies bought auction-rate debt from municipalities, charitable organizations, student lenders and closed- end mutual funds. The securities had long-term maturities but functioned like a short-term investment, paying interest rates that were reset in weekly or monthly auctions conducted by Wall Street firms. Brokerage firms and financial advisers pitched them to investors as a safe place to stash one's cash and collect a higher yield than a money-market fund offered, often tax-free.As a result, the $330 billion auction-rate securities market attracted many investors who were risk-averse or, like Ms. Walsh, knew they would need the money in the near future.

Thus there is some evidence that current prices have rather fully discounted a fairly sizable earnings recovery that is not clear-i ]y within a forecasting range at this juncture.. But in spite of all this apparent justification for concluding that stock prices are high, it remains a fact that the market last week was strong. Any discussion of the reasons for the unusual strength must give recognition to another fact: the bond market was as weak as the stock market was strong. Attention to this contrast is significant: it supports other evidence that an inflationary flight of investment funds from the dollar and from long-term debt instruments I into equities is in full swing. And it appears that this movement is gaining momentum.Under these circumstances, it is little wonder that so many people are puzzled by the apparent disregard of the stock market for earnings and dividends. Most of the time there is an understandable relationship between the prices of individual stocks and their earnings, earnings prospects and dividends, and also between yields obtainable from dividends of stocks and the yields obtainable from investments in bonds and mort-agages.The recent deviation of stock price behavior from these conventional measurements, then, is unusualUOand meaningful from a broad national and international viewpoint In fact, some of the evidence presented above suggests that the present situation is more unusual in this respect than at any time since 1929, when the condition was spelling out a hazardous situation.FEW PEOPLE WOULD deny the assertion that the demand for common stocks and the simultaneous disfavor j for bonds reflect an inflation psychology which seems to be ! increasing in intensity, it is a i UIchicken and the eggU sequence, but, in addition to inflationary psychology, we also* have to recognize the presence of distinctly inflationary facts.

Also true, itUas better for a President not to promise big things .that he canUat produce. Further true, thereUas a lot to be said for restraint in fiddling with the American economy in its present uncertain condition. Mr. Carter accepts all of those truths. ThatUas why his various proposals to hold down inflation are not going to change very much, very quickly. Meanwhile, the inflation rate seems to be rising.Consumer prices have risen 6 per cent over the past year. But during the winter they were rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent. Some of that acceleration was due to cold weather, but not all of it. Mr. Carter has set himself the target of reversing this trend and getting the rate down to 4 per cent by the end of 1979. How?HeUas right in excluding mandatory controls. Aside from any questions of policy, the legal authority to impose them has expired. If Mr. Carter tried to get a new law, the first reaction would be a wildfire of anticipatory price increases. All the people who were taken by surprise in 1971 by the Nixon controls are determined not to let it happen again. Politicians sometimes think of the economy as a great machine. But the machine has a memory.That memory would even make it perilous for Mr. Carter to try to set wage and price guideposts.

Should you chase the market and take profits, go into low-yielding CDs or money-market funds, or just stay putUa One viable option is fixed-rate annuities, which are commonly known as guaranteed return annuities (GRAs).A GRA is an investment contract made with an insurance company in which your money accumulates and compounds free from current income taxes. It is this tax-deferred compounding of income that makes a GRA an exceptional investment The investor chooses the length of the interest-rate guarantee period, from one month to 10 years.The tax-free compounding enables your savings to grow much more rapidly than say, a certificate of deposit For example, if you are in the 33 percent tax bracket, a CD paying 8 percent will double your money (your after-tax return is 5.4 percent) in 13V4 years, while that same money in a tax-deferred annuity would double in 8'/; years. You pay taxes only when you withdraw your earnings, and if that occurs after you retire, it more than likely will be at a reduced tax rate.What is key for the investor is the quality of the insurance company, along with the interest rate being paid and the various features in the annuity plan.

Collectively, those investors -- think mutual funds, pension funds and foreign central banks -- could lose hundreds of billions of dollars if they're mistaken and the United States has a debt crisis.Perceptions inside the Beltway rest on this idea: Although the current large budget deficit is caused mainly by the weak economy and a short-term economic stimulus that will soon expire, in the longer run the government faces a vast unfunded burden, particularly tied to Medicare and Medicaid.The mix of spending cuts and tax increases that could close the gap are wildly unpopular.

And many Republicans have declared they will not vote for a package that includes a tax increase under any circumstance.This situation led Moody's, the debt-rating firm, to state in March that the U.S. government is nearer to being at risk of losing its Aaa credit rating and that maintaining the rating might require adjustments to tax and spending policy ""of a magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion.""",0,0.6818,0.31820000000000004,1360

By proclaiming 1983 to be UIThe Year of the Bible,U President Reagan presumably means to extend the theme of economic recession into the political and intellectual theaters of operation. When he released his proclamation to a national prayer breakfast, Reagan observed that the Bible holds within its pages UIall the answers to ail the problems that mankind has ever known.ULast year, Americans bought $170 million worth of Bibles, which suggests that Reagan may have shaped His proclamation to fit the desperate wish for simple answers to the dilemmasSof the age. Although the Bible may provide certain truths to all the problems of mankind, revelation is also available by a reading of the Koran, the Confu-cian Analects, the Homeric poems, PlatoUas Dialogues and the canon. of ShakespeareUas plays. The problems] to which the Bible speaks have to do with the government of menUas souls, not with the government of states.What, then, does Reagan mean by his proclamation? Surely he cannot suppose that a modern nation-state can dress itself in the rags of Christian humility. ChristUas teachings do violence both to the spirit and the flesh of capitalism^ Were Reagan to attempt putting the gospels into effect, he would end by forcing the banks to give up the practice of usury and obliging the Pentagon to beat its missiles into plowshares.Apparently it is not enough that the country in many ways has begun to resemble the industrial ruin of thp 1930s. The president proposes to conduct the nation still farther backward in time, roughly to the period between 600 B.C. and 100 A.D.The question remains as to which of these 700 years the president thinks most suitable for a safe return.

Instead, they said their plan encourages managers to develop tailor-made reviews based on the size and complexity of their businesses.Corporate managers have criticized outside auditors for performing unnecessary and expensive work to protect themselves from liability and make more money.

In real terms, adjusted for inflation, spending on production of planes, ships, tanks and ammunition has fallen 70 percent since 1985.This year, though, the Clinton administration is trying to reverse that slide, asking Congress in the president's recently released budget for the first real increase in defense procurement in 13 years. As the chart at the right shows, this reversal comes as the overall defense budget -- which includes spending for operations, maintenance and personnel in addition to weaponry -- is barely rising.

By 2000, the plan calls for $54.1 billion in procurement spending, and the number rises to $63.5 billion by 2003.The spending shift can be attributed to the need to modernize many of the military's older weapons as well as the administration's desire to begin production of some 21st-century programs.",0,1.0,0.0,2235
546,"John Cochrane: The Federal Reserve: From Central Bank to Central Planner; The Fed's 'nontraditional' actions have crossed a bright line into fiscal policy and the direct allocation of credit.. Momentous changes are under way in what central banks are and what they do. We are used to thinking that central banks' main task is to guide the economy by setting interest rates. Central banks' main tools used to be ""open-market"" operations, i.e. purchasing short-term Treasury debt, and short-term lending to banks.Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Federal Reserve has intervened in a wide variety of markets, including commercial paper, mortgages and long-term Treasury debt. At the height of the crisis, the Fed lent directly to teetering nonbank institutions, such as insurance giant AIG, and participated in several shotgun marriages, most notably between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.These ""nontraditional"" interventions are not going away anytime soon. Many Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, see ""credit constraints"" and ""segmented markets"" throughout the economy, which the Fed's standard tools don't address. Moreover, interest rates near zero have rendered those tools nearly powerless, so the Fed will naturally search for bigger guns. In his speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke made it clear that ""we should not rule out the further use of such [nontraditional] policies if economic conditions warrant.""But the Fed has crossed a bright line. Open-market operations do not have direct fiscal consequences, or directly allocate credit. That was the price of the Fed's independence, allowing it to do one thing--conduct monetary policy--without short-term political pressure. But an agency that allocates credit to specific markets and institutions, or buys assets that expose taxpayers to risks, cannot stay independent of elected, and accountable, officials.In addition, the Fed is now a gargantuan financial regulator. Its inspectors examine too-big-to-fail banks, come up with creative ""stress tests"" for them to pass, and haggle over thousands of pages of regulation. When we think of the Fed 10 years from now, on current trends, we're likely to think of it as financial czar first, with monetary policy the boring backwater.",0,1.0,0.0,1758

The productivity of nonfarm businesses surged so strongly in the final three months of last year that the cost of labor in the average item produced went down for the second quarter in a row, the Labor Department reported yesterday.The striking gains in labor efficiency offset a poorer performance in the first half of 1993 and left unit labor costs only 1.3 percent higher than they were a year earlier. Such a small rise in payrolls, which are most employers' single biggest cost, means inflation might fall further, or at least not worsen, analysts said.The department said that output of goods and services at businesses other than farms rose at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year while the number of hours worked went up at only a 2.3 percent rate. That combination meant that productivity - output per hour worked - rose at a 4.2 percent rate.In manufacturing alone, productivity shot up at a huge 7.8 percent annual rate in the quarter, with rates of increase in output of 9.2 percent and in hours worked of only 1.2 percent.

565,"Cooling Off About Keeping Up; What's 'Competitiveness'?. A prominent journalist wrote in 1947: ""The basic power determinant of any country is its steel production, and what makes this a great nation above all is the fact that it can roll over 90 million tons of steel ingots a year, more than Great Britain, prewar Germany, Japan, France, and the Soviet Union combined."" Well, that was then. In 2005 the United States ranked third in raw steel production. Its output (95 million metric tons) was behind Japan's (113 million tons) and less than a third of China's (349 million). So?We are experiencing another competitiveness panic. These occur every 15 or 20 years. There's an outpouring of worried reports and articles. After Sputnik in 1957 -- the first artificial Earth satellite -- we were supposedly doomed to be overtaken by the Soviet Union. In the late 1970s and 1980s, it was Germany and then Japan. Lately, China and India have been the threats. Through it all, the United States has remained the dominant global economy, representing about one-fifth of the world's total output.If it means keeping the lead in every industry where we once led, we're doomed. As other countries develop, they create larger and better industries to meet their needs. Steel is an example. The United States doesn't need 350 million tons of steel. Textiles, consumer electronics and automobiles are other industries where we've lost ground to countries that have greater local needs, lower costs or better management. In many cases, U.S. multinational companies have relocated plants abroad to cut costs.Similarly, if competitiveness requires the United States to maintain its present share of the world economy, we are also probably doomed. We have recently maintained our share only because Europe and Japan have grown more slowly than the United States. But if China and India continue to grow rapidly, the U.S. share will shrink. The U.S. economy is now about $13 trillion; China's is about $2.2 trillion, says economist Nicholas Lardy of the Institute for International Economics. China's growth is 9 to 10 percent annually; the United States' is 3 to 4 percent. At those rates, China might pass the United States in 20 or 30 years, says Lardy. (However, per capita incomes in China would still be much lower.) The point: Global economic growth -- something the United States encourages -- erodes America's dominance. Technology, talent and wealth spread everywhere.One possible ""competitiveness"" definition is the ability of countries to stay ahead in developing new industries. Economists once saw land, labor and capital as the basic inputs of any economy. But they've now added ""knowledge,"" as David Warsh -- former economics columnist for the Boston Globe -- shows in his engaging book ""Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations.""

567,"S&Ls: Much More Than Sleaze. It may have been the financial scandal of the century, yet the savings and loan crisis remains shrouded in mythology. Every S&L story features sleazy bankers and politicians. The scandal has become a giant caricature: a classic example (it is said) of how greed, corruption and inept regulation cost taxpayers between $500 billion and $1 trillion. Well, not exactly.In many ways, the popular perception is badly distorted. Ignored in its infancy, the scandal has been sensationalized in its maturity. Its costs, though huge, have been exaggerated, and its causes have been overdramatized. This makes good copy but bad history. There was more than sleaze to this. As the crisis fades into folklore, we need to pause and recall what actually happened and why. Let's start by puncturing some common myths.In fact, the big villain was inflation. Until the 1970s, S&Ls were a safe business. They took deposits at 3 or 4 percent and then lent the money as long-term home mortgages at 6 or 7 percent. Profits were almost guaranteed. Rising inflation destroyed this formula. Short- term deposit rates rose, leaving S&Ls with tens of billions of dollars in mortgages at lower rates. Losses exploded. By 1982, only 15 percent of S&Ls were profitable, and two-thirds were technically insolvent. Assets (mainly mortgages) were worth less than liabilities (mainly deposits).After that, there was plenty of inept management and bad government regulation. But everything flowed from the inflation. The Reagan administration and Congress gambled that the industry could be saved. S&Ls' lending powers were broadened to permit more lucrative loans on office buildings and other commercial construction projects. The gamble backfired. S&Ls - not experienced in these areas - made billions of dollars of lousy loans. A bad situation became worse.We can now see what happened. Because deposits were insured by the government, S&Ls could tap unlimited amounts of funds. They lured the funds with high interest rates. S&Ls then played with taxpayers' money. If new investments succeeded, the S&Ls would become profitable. If not, taxpayers would pick up the losses. Some S&Ls were taken over by high-fliers: the Charles Keatings of the world. But criminality was not the main problem; recklessness was. No one really knows how much outright fraud raised the bailout's cost. Estimates vary from 3 to 25 percent, according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office.",0,0.6659,0.33409999999999995,3649

The plan would require a 40-hour workweek, instead of 30, with accommodations for parents with infants or other special circumstances.As a concession to governors and congressional Democrats, the plan would let states count 16 hours of education or other job preparation toward the 40 hours of required ""work.""

573,"Many Investment Strategies May Falter Because of Hidden Economic Assumptions. Many people rely on some basic investment approaches that over the years have produced superior stock market results.But such strategies -- which may include focusing on high dividend yields, small capitalizations or low price-earnings ratios, to name but a few -- all involve broad economic bets that investors don't always realize they're making. At certain times, market analysts say, investors can get torpedoed by these hidden assumptions.For instance, buying stocks with high dividends, as many investors have since last fall's stock market crash, tends to produce a portfolio that lags the market in a rally. Small-capitalization stocks tend to be vulnerable if interest rates fall, as they have over much of the past few years. Stocks judged by their price-earnings ratios may look most attractive just before they're ready to tumble -- or terrible just when they're bottoming out.""It doesn't do much good to know the price-earnings ratio or the (capitalization) of a stock unless you know how those characteristics relate to the behavior of financial markets,"" says Stephen A.

581,"The Outlook: New 'One-Worlders' Are Conservatives. WASHINGTON -- The ""one-worlders"" are back.Once upon a time, it was fashionable to label as ""one-worlders"" radical socialists who believed that national governments were an anachronism and that the peoples of the world would one day unite under a single workers' state. Those folks aren't very numerous anymore. Even in the Soviet Union, the concept is in disrepute.But some new ""one-worlders"" have emerged-conservatives, this time.They are the economists and academics who believe that in a global economy, with goods and especially capital surging across political borders, the economic fortunes of individual countries aren't important anymore. The U.S. trade deficit and other statistics, they argue, are only artificial figures in what has become a multinational corporate economy in which political distinctions matter little. It's all one big market, they contend, so why worry about it?These experts see the world economy almost solely in financial terms and dispute the idea that relative economic flows can have real long-term effects on national security or geopolitical power. When it comes to whether the U.S. remains a world leader if its junior allies are its senior creditors, their motto is, ""Don't worry, be happy.""",0,0.6617,0.33830000000000005,1947

583,"Fed Official Says Bank Should Have Done More. Federal Reserve officials have been criticized by many outsiders in recent years for pursuing easy-money policies too aggressively and risking inflation. A senior Fed official on Monday said the Fed has made mistakes in recent years--but he said the big mistake was the opposite of the common critique. The Fed erred, he said, in not doing enough.""Monetary policy, while highly accommodative by historic standards, may still not have been sufficiently accommodative given the economic circumstances,"" William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech in New York.Many U.S. academics--including Ben Bernanke before he became Fed chairman--criticized the Bank of Japan in the 1990s and early 2000s for responding to its financial crisis and subsequent recession too timidly. Mr. Dudley's comments suggested the Fed might have made the same mistake.The Fed pushed short-term interest rates to near zero in late 2008 and has said it is likely to keep them there until at least mid-2015. Moreover, it has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system while purchasing long-term U.S. Treasury debt and mortgage backed securities. The policies are meant to push down long-term interest rates to encourage spending, investment and growth.""My conclusion is that the easing of financial conditions resulting from non-traditional policy actions has had a material effect on both nominal and real growth and has demonstrably reduced the risk of particularly adverse outcomes,"" Mr. Dudley said. ""Nevertheless, I also conclude that, with the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive.""",0,1.0,0.0,4888

TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal posted increased net incomes for their fiscal second quarters as prudence helped them weather the recent economic slowdown and stock-market volatility.Canadian banks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts as the economy has soured, partly because the Canadian companies had less exposure to deteriorating credit. ""Canadian banks are relatively cautious,"" said Kevin Choquette, a Toronto analyst with Scotia Capital, the brokerage arm of Bank of Nova Scotia.Credit problems for Canadian banks have also been milder because Canada emerged a year later than the U.S. from the last recession, Mr. Choquette added.

NEW YORK -- The securities and investment communities will form a committee to suggest major changes to speed up the processing of securities trades.The committee, which is expected to make its recommendations toward the end of this year, is the U.S. response to a call for uniform securities processing made last March by the Group of Thirty, an international body of bankers and other financial executives. The international body is seeking to tighten by the end of 1992 cash and securities settlement and clearance procedures, which proved weak during the stock market crash of October 1987.Pressure for international uniformity also is coming from U.S. institutional investors such as pension and mutual funds, Gerard P. Lynch, a Morgan Stanley & Co. managing director, said in an interview after a news conference. He explained that institutions increasingly are investing in large blocks of foreign securities, and need prompt valuations of their portfolios.The industry committee is expected to urge that U.S. securities markets uniformly move to a settlement system where cash and securities are exchanged within three business days after a trade, instead of the present five days. The group also is expected to urge that it take no more than one business day to clear, or match, purchase and sales orders. Certain markets, including the New York Stock Exchange, already are moving toward next-day clearance.The intended formation of the committee was announced by Lewis W. Bernard, head of the Group of Thirty's U.S. steering unit, following a briefing of about 60 U.S. securities regulators and executives. Although Mr. Bernard said that the committee probably would present a plan by the fourth quarter, he added that the 1992 target for implementation ""is a very, very aggressive date.""

I ought to ""take a vow of embarrassed silence,"" it said, for claiming that ethanol's contribution to the food crisis is ""overblown."" The Journal's claims would be laughable if the stakes were not so high.Cellulosic biofuels offer a chance to have an environmentally meaningful impact on petroleum use while benefiting farmers, entrepreneurs and consumers. I have many investments in biofuels companies. Some say I believe in biofuels because I have invested in them. The truth is that I invest in biofuels because I believe they can help our environment, economy and national security.Just as the word ""drug"" can refer to aspirin or cocaine, ""biofuel"" refers to a variety of products that vary dramatically in their environmental impact and effects on food prices. For instance, biodiesel from food oils such as soybean or palm oil has traditionally created environmental negatives. But corn ethanol has been a stepping stone to cellulosic ethanol, a preferred alternative that is likely to achieve unsubsidized market competitiveness with oil within a few years.We face an energy crisis, an environmental crisis and a terrorism crisis all related to oil. High-cost options to reduce consumption, such as hybrid and electric cars, sound good but are unlikely to materially reduce carbon emissions. To have a meaningful impact, at least half of the next billion cars manufactured on this planet must be low-carbon. The only cost-effective option (measured in cost per ton of carbon emissions avoided or grams of carbon emissions per mile driven) likely to achieve broad market acceptance in the next 20 years is cellulosic-fuel cars.Unfortunately, biofuels are the target of interested parties' paid campaigns. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, for example, is waging a multimillion-dollar campaign against ethanol; the American Petroleum Institute is more concerned about food prices than oil prices. Slogans about how much corn and water are required to produce a gallon of ethanol are repeated frequently. In fact, a 16-ounce steak takes about the same amount of corn and more water. Should we ban steaks, too? Similarly, hybrid cars are hyped, but we seldom hear that they reduce carbon emissions about as much as corn ethanol, and at a cost that is substantially higher than flex-fuel cars.",0,1.0,0.0,4560

While the federal government has pressured corporations to fully fund their pension plans, it has allowed the retirement programs for federal civilian and military employees to become underfunded by more than $1 trillion.The shortfall in these government pension plans has remained largely hidden, experts said, even though it poses risks to taxpayers and federal workers. Although the pensions have been promised, the $1 trillion in underfunding is a taxpayer obligation that is not reflected in federal deficit figures.""It is huge,"" said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Washington- based Employee Benefit Research Institute.

609,"Financial Creativity Counts When it's Time to Sell a House. Q Our house has been on the market for some time, and even though interest rates are favorable, market conditions appear to be working against us. We have to sell and have heard about a concept called ""creative financing.U Can you explain what this means and how it works?A Although UIcreative financingU probably started when the first homeowners sold their house, the modern concept began in the early 1980s, when interest rates throughout the United States skyrocketed. Lenders and sellers began looking for new kinds of mortgage financing, which would offer attractive incentives so that reluctant buyers would go forward with the sale.From the lenderUas perspective, one of the most creative loans was the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Under such a transaction, the interest rate fluctuates at regular intervals, typically once a year. Although the most common ARM is the one-year transaction, there are many varieties on this, including six-month ARMs, three-year ARMs and five-year ARMs. With any ARM, the rate will be considerably lower than the rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, although the longer the term of the adjustment on the ARM the higher the interest rate will be.But this was not enough to entice buyers into the marketplace. Sellers also began to look for their own creative types of financing, and here are a number of ideas that may assist you in marketing your house. b Seller takes back first trust. Let us assume that your house is worth $250,000. If you have no mortgage on the property, you can take back all of the financing, and you in effect will be the bank.Under no circumstances can I recommend that you make more than an 80 percent loan, and in our example, you should not lend more than $200,000. That means that your buyer will have to come up with $50,000, which may be a significant deterrent. However, if you were to lend the buyer as much as $230,000, for example, you run the risk that if your buyer becomes delinquent, and you have to foreclose, the house may have depreciated in value. This is a business, not a legal, decision that only you can make.",0,1.0,0.0,951
610,"The Big 10. It's no exaggeration to say that the 1980s were dominated by economics. The politics and psychology of these 10 years have swirled around the central issue of how nations enhance their wealth. Ronald Reagan's economic policies undergirded his popularity. Communism's economic failure triggered political upheavals in the Soviet Bloc and China. Japan's emergence as a great power primarily reflects its stunning economic success.Greedy is the glib label stuck onto the '80s. How silly. Greed had never disappeared; it merely became more conspicuous. The decade's significance lies elsewhere. We rediscovered some old truths about economics. Competition works. It generates economic growth by fostering efficiency and innovation. In the '80s, U.S. living standards and productivity rose. But competition can be rough, and the decade seems baffling precisely because its gains often emerged from disruptive changes.We endured fierce foreign competition and the worst recession since World War II. Corporate America was no longer invincible. It faced hostile takeovers as well as rising imports. Companies were forced to become more efficient and to hold down costs and prices. But their responses-layoffs, plant shutdowns and streamlining-were often hurtful and unsettling.It's been that kind of confusing decade. Looking back, I'd cite 10 major economic trends that will affect the '90s.1) The Triumph of Free Markets: Faith in competition replaced the view that government spending and low interest rates spur economic growth. The result has been stingier government, higher ""real"" (after-inflation) interest rates and more emphasis on free markets. The change is global. From Mexico to France, state-owned companies have been sold (""privatized""). Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and China are trying market policies.",0,0.6855,0.3145,55
611,"Why government numbers don't add up. Critics of government spending are fond of using federal economic statistics to buttress their arguments. But in one of the ironies for which the debate is famous, one of the few programs to be pared to the bone has been the data collection system itself. This has led over the past decade to an archaic system of statistics collection that often results in flawed analyses.Yesterday's release of revised 1992 gross domestic product data by the Commerce Department highlights the need for more accurate reporting of economic statistics by the federal government. Indeed, these revisions show that the slow-growth assumptions behind the Clinton economic policy were fundamentally flawed.The accompanying chart shows how economic growth accelerated at a much more rapid pace in 1992 than initially estimated (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Sep. 1, 1993). It also shows a series of revisions that occurred from 1989 through 1991; in seven of the 12 quarters, growth was initially overestimated, leading the Bush economic team astray. In the fourth quarter of last year, the recovery from Hurricane Andrew may have caused a surge in economic activity, but growth was underestimated for all four quarters of 1992.Recent research by the Statistics Committee of the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) shows that the misestimation of growth has followed a counter-cyclical pattern dating back as far as early 1986 and continuing in 1992. In 1986-88, when growth was relatively strong, economic activity was underestimated. In 1989-91, when growth was slowing and then declining, economic activity was overestimated. We now know that growth was underestimated in 1992.NABE research also shows that misestimation of GDP has caused serious problems in forecasting economic events. These forecasts and the econometric models that produce them drive billions of dollars of investment activity -- making forecast accuracy a major concern for Wall Street's stock and bond specialists.",0,1.0,0.0,3713

613,"The American Way of Death Evolves. The number of cremations in the U.S. has tripled in the past generation. The cremation rate is now about 17% -- though the rate varies widely from state to state. In Hawaii cremation already has surpassed burial, but in West Virginia cremation accounts for only 2% of the total. Americans are following the lead of Britain, where cremation has increased from less than 3% in 1936 to more than 70% now.Heating technology is a primary cause for the gradual change of attitude toward cremation in the West. If the bonfires used in ancient cultures had continued to be the only means of cremation, the spade would continue to triumph over the torch in Western cultures. But contemporary cremations are neither a public spectacle nor a private repulsion.Crematoria used to be located only in cemeteries away from heavily populated areas, due to public concern about smoke from cremations. Today, the smoke is recycled so that the carbon particles are completely burned. Only odorless vapors escape through a flue from the afterburner chamber. Most units in the U.S. are fired by natural gas. About 500 cubic feet of gas is used in a single cremation, costing several dollars.Although death customs are usually the slowest of all customs to change, Americans are experiencing an increasing amount of dissatisfaction with conventional funeral practices. Funeral costs are a major factor in the decline of burials. Since 1984, funeral costs have risen almost twice as fast as the consumer price index; today an average burial costs $5,000, while the average cost of a cremation is a small fraction of this amount. Telophase, which claims to be the country's fastest growing cremation society, has an inclusive charge of $500.Public policy encourages the cremation option. Social Security death benefits of $255 are available to most survivors of covered workers. Also, the Veterans Administration provides a $300 funeral allowance. For welfare recipients, the benefits vary from state to state. Economic considerations should not be overestimated, however, since cremation accounts for the majority of body disposals in Marin County, Calif. -- one of America's most affluent areas.",0,1.0,0.0,666

619,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Plastic Posturing. How high is ""too high"" for credit card interest rates? The House Banking and Urban Affairs Committee took up this question last week before Congress broke for summer recess. Its verdict amounted to a split decision. It rejected a proposal by Rep. Frank Annunzio to cap credit rates at eight percentage points above the yield of one-year Treasury bills, while approving a measure requiring uniform disclosure of credit terms in solicitations and applications. (Currently, such disclosure is only required upon issuance of a credit card).Despite the setback, the credit card cap likely will be offered to the full House when the disclosure bill comes to a floor vote after the recess. It amounts to legislative posturing. To the extent the cap has any effect at all it will simply create greater inconvenience for the majority of the nation's 75 million credit card users.The most likely response by the industry to rate ceilings would be higher annual fees for some users, lower credit limits for others, and reduction or even elimination of grace periods on interest charges (which are now generally 25 days between the day of purchase and the day interest charges begin). Many if not most credit card users would come out worse for this trade-off.The Annunzio amendment is modeled after laws on the books in about a dozen states that cap card interest rates. The experience of Arkansas, which boasts the most restrictive ceiling (pegged at 5% above the federal discount rate, meaning a current rate of 10.5%), is instructive. The biggest credit card casualties in Arkansas are lower- and lower-middle income households, according to a study by Purdue University's Credit Research Center. They are less likely to hold credit cards than their counterparts in ceilingless states. Moreover, Arkansas banks offer fewer credit card options than competitors in other states, and most importantly, no grace periods. The result is that half of the cards issued to Arkansas residents come from out-of-state banks.On the face, interest rates on bank cards -- currently averaging nearly 19% -- appear high. But there is little evidence to show an absence in the credit card business of the competitive forces that set prices in other industries.",0,1.0,0.0,4853

Unfortunately, the outcome is often less cheery than the advertisements imply. While consolidation can indeed lower your monthly payments, it's frequently a faster road to bankruptcy than to financial salvation, many debt specialists say.The problem: Consolidation loans feed on the temptations that land many consumers in debt in the first place. You feel as if you can afford another shopping spree once monthly payments are lower.Consumers with severe debt problems and poor credit also tend to get socked with extra fees and higher interest rates when they consolidate, making the loan even harder to pay off.

WASHINGTON -- Technology and foreign investment are making income inequality worse around the world, the International Monetary Fund said in a new report, handing critics of globalization a powerful argument to use in their political battles.The IMF's findings, published in the fund's semiannual economic review, the World Economic Outlook, confirm the work of other economists, who have been trying to figure out why income inequality has widened in both rich and poor countries in the past two decades. The report is an unusual admission by the IMF of the downsides of globalization.Since at least the 1980s, the IMF has pressed countries to open their borders to foreign investment, technology and trade as a path to economic growth -- and has channeled loans to countries that took its advice.An anti-IMF and antiglobalization backlash developed in many parts of the world, especially Latin America and Africa, when the economies that followed the fund's prescription didn't grow as rapidly as anticipated. Now, that antiglobalization movement, which has spread to the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia, has become a political barrier to further liberalization of trade, investment and the migration of workers.Subir Lall, the IMF's deputy chief for research, said the report had no political agenda. He said it found that, overall, wealth increased through globalization. In the great majority of countries, the income of lower-income workers has risen in the past two decades, but at a slower pace than for higher-skilled workers. As a result, the gap between haves and have-nots has widened.",0,0.6881,0.3119,4905

So Osborn, a venture capitalist, set out to beat them at their own game by pumping more than $50,000 into the campaigns to support eight slow-growth candidates for the county board of supervisors in 1999. They all won.Stunned by the defeat, pro-development interests in the Washington suburb have vowed to unseat the new board, which has sliced more than 80,000 houses from county plans. ""If you are a major player in a billion-dollar industry, are you going to let your industry evaporate?"" asked Bryan Brooks, a local developer. The developers' response? Up the ante.That's no small threat in Virginia, known nationally as the Wild West of campaign finance. There are no contribution limits for state or local offices here, making anything possible. ""If you want to give $6 billion to some guy who's running for sheriff or local delegate, you can do it,"" says Steve Calos, executive director of the Richmond-based Center for Open, Ethical and Accountable Government.Big money goes small town? You betcha. Americans are used to thinking of national politics as the place where the big decisions get made -- and where the big money gets spent. That premise drove the campaign finance reform legislation President Bush signed last month. But that ballyhooed legislation did nothing to stem the flow of money to local and state campaigns. Local politics are just as fortified -- some say corrupted -- by cash as federal ones, and often more so. From the Blue Ridge mountain foothills of Loudoun to Laguna Hills, Calif., the excesses of K Street are flourishing on the Main Streets that lead to the nation's state houses, city halls and county buildings.The most intimate arena of our democracy can also be the easiest to manipulate. A little money can go a long way in local contests. The rules are looser, and fewer people are watching to see if those rules are followed. Voter turnout is often lower, giving one-issue champions and special interest groups greater influence. As on Capitol Hill, contributions often make great investments.

NEW YORK -- The movie industry is off to a strong start for 1989, thanks to the continuing box office draw of a number of Christmas movies that helped boost 1988 revenue 3.5%, to a record $4.4 billion.But industry analysts differ over how long the current crop of movies will draw patrons, and they question whether the industry can sustain the annual increases that have brought box office revenue to record highs in each of the past few years. A.D. Murphy, who compiled the box office data for Variety, the show business newspaper, for example, said the industry's prosperity may be ""peaking"" and that the industry may be about to enter another recession.Walt Disney Co., as expected, emerged as the industry's market share leader, with 19.5% of the 1988 revenue, even though the studio didn't have a huge Christmas hit. Gulf & Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit was the box office leader at Christmas with ""Scrooged"" and ""The Naked Gun."" But because of a less impressive release schedule earlier in the year, Paramount came in No. 2 for 1988 with a 15.2% share of box office revenue.Fewer pictures were released in the 1988 holiday season than in most previous years, and so far, none of the holiday releases has emerged as a potential $100 million-plus blockbuster. But a number of movies, as expected, sold between $25 million and $55 million in tickets.

WASHINGTON -- For the first time in years, the dreaded word ""recession"" is back as a buzzword. Oddly, though, it will be months -- or even years -- before economists know for sure if the U.S. has entered one, partly because the definition is fluid.The most common definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. This was the explanation President Clinton used to defend his legacy when reporters asked whether President-elect George W. Bush was inheriting a Clinton recession.But that definition isn't widely embraced by economists. ""Economic growth is sort of more on a continuum, there's nothing special about zero,"" says Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw. His introductory economics textbook, ""Principles of Economics,"" defines a recession more generally as ""a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment."" In some cases, he says, two quarters may be too much. ""If you had a big enough fall in one quarter, you'd probably call that a recession, too,"" he says.For professional economists, the ultimate arbiter of economic peaks and troughs is the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee.

641,"Other Views on the Value of the SAT. Since you asked for our feedback about your article on SAT tests [""What the SAT Tests Are Really Scoring,"" Fairfax Extra, Sept. 8], I will give you my two cents as a parent of a Madison High School senior.First of all, unlike you, I am a fan of the SAT. I think it's critical to efficiency in college admissions, given that some school districts practice rampant grade inflation and others (including Fairfax County) do not. Without the objectivity of having SAT grades, colleges would be missing a critical piece of information in their admissions processes. As I am sure you know, studies have indeed found the SAT to be a good and useful predictor of how well kids do in college.On the other hand, I agree with you that the average SAT grade of a school's students doesn't tell one much about whether that school is a good place to learn. After all, even with the changes, it's still pretty much an aptitude test. Thus, it's going to correlate more with IQ than with the quality of teachers. Moreover, if one's goal is to get into the most selective college possible, I think there's probably a decent argument to be made that one may be better off in one of the less elite high schools, taking as many tough courses as possible and perhaps standing out more from the pack.Your Sept. 8 column was a good piece, but it was incomplete because it did not include several relevant factors affecting SAT scores. While poverty does correlate with SAT achievement, a more powerful correlation appears to be culture.Asians in general and the immigrants from some Latin countries have a deep cultural reverence for education that transcends economic status. On the other hand, domestic underclass culture, particularly that of many African Americans, denigrates promising black students as ""acting white,"" as if scholarship was a racial characteristic.",0,0.6671,0.3329,2138

He also spoke of ""numerous irregularities"" in the voting, without being more specific.About half a million ballots were declared invalid, and if they are re-examined, as members of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition have demanded, it is possible the outcome of the vote could flip. A recount could prompt a period of political uncertainty and lead to a contested final outcome -- a situation analogous to the protracted stalemate between George W. Bush and Al Gore following the U.S. presidential election in 2000.In addition, the vote leaves room for the 69-year-old Mr. Berlusconi, who has made a career of defying the odds, to wield tremendous influence on the political stage.

One of my biggest investments, Comerica Inc., was picked to take Shawmut's place in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and indexers began buying truckloads of Comerica shares. That produced a windfall for those of us who owned the stock.Welcome to the wonderful world of indexing. S&P announced last Tuesday evening that Comerica was joining the S&P 500. Comerica officially joined the index when the stock market closed on Thursday. By then, its stock had risen $2.12 1/2, a nice 6 percent jump from its Tuesday close. My 800 Comerica shares -- the biggest single holding in my retirement accounts -- were thus worth $1,700 more than they were two days earlier.

Had some divine power alleviated the problems wracking Detroit, Comerica's hometown and biggest single market?Nope.

648,"Wealth Management (A Special Report): Alternative Investing --- Why Now May Be a Good Time for Investors to Buy Preferred Shares. Q: Are preferred shares a good investment in this market and are they closer to bonds or stocks?A: Preferred shares are complex investments that have similarities to both equities and debt. Preferred shares trade like stocks and are a claim on the assets and earnings of a company, just like common shares. But they hold a higher claim on the assets than common stock. That makes preferreds a somewhat safer investment.While preferred shares usually don't have voting rights, they pay a regular dividend that can be substantial, making them similar in some ways to bonds. Dividends paid by preferred shares usually must be paid out before common shareholders receive their dividends.""Preferred shares are slightly more like bonds than stocks as their historical price volatility more closely matches that of bonds,"" says Andrew Zimmerman, chief investment strategist at DT Investment Partners LLC. Just like bonds, they can be called by the issuer in times of falling interest rates, he notes.""Since preferred shares are sensitive to interest-rate movements, their prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa,"" he says. ""However, since they offer such relatively high yields, the income component of preferred shares can help to offset the price decline in periods of small interest-rate spikes.""",0,1.0,0.0,2650

Net interest revenue fell by a third to $724 million but rose slightly from the previous quarter.In the third quarter, the bank, formed in July 2007 when Bank of New York acquired Mellon Financial Corp., sold or restructured billions of dollars in risky investments, a move that hurt its bottom line at the time but set it up for fewer one-time charges or losses.

664,"A Sarbanes-Oxley for Congress?. Every April 15 we ask: What is the government doing with my tax dollars?We know how much Congress spends, but to what end? The Department of Education received $67 billion in 2004, but do children read better? The government spends $30 billion on agriculture annually. Most of these subsidies go to the wealthiest farmers, including Ted Turner, making it our largest corporate welfare program. Was this the intent?Since 1993, the Government Performance and Results Act has required agencies to submit an annual performance report of goals and progress -- not unlike what shareholders expect from publicly traded companies -- an accounting of the agency's activities and financial condition. In spite of this law, some agencies still lag in transparently reporting on their goals and activities. According to the FY 2004 Annual Scorecard of agency performance reports (produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University), only 11% of the budget is covered by good reporting: The biggest agencies are still trying to articulate their goals and show public benefits, i.e. they don't know what results our dollars are delivering.We are all shareholders in the largest fiscal entity in the U.S.: the federal government. This year's proposed budget equals $2.57 trillion, a figure likely to increase when the final budget passes Congress. The majority, 55%, goes to entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. Discretionary activity consumes 37%, split evenly between defense and non-defense activities. The remaining 8% pays for interest on debt. Spending on entitlement programs will keep rising as baby boomers retire. And discretionary spending is also likely to creep ever higher. Without a change in budgetary behavior, spending as a share of GDP will rise to 40% by 2040. According to Comptroller General David Walker, balancing the budget in that year will require cutting spending by 60% or raising taxes to two-and-a- half times today's level.Before imagining the horror of that tax bill, or the political fallout of slashing swaths of federal programs, such measures may be unnecessary if the government starts allocating money according to program effectiveness, not political calculation. It's common sense (but not general practice in Congress) that the government should only spend money on activities that show results.

669,"Essential to the Debate. A few weeks ago, Newsweek ran a cover story that was a model of magazine journalism (the Aug. 30 issue, in case you missed it). Called ""A World Without Fathers,"" it explored in unsparing terms the decline of the two-parent black family. The story was exceptional less for breaking new ground than for forcing all of us, black and white, to think about realities we'd prefer to ignore. A young black child now has only a 1 in 5 chance of growing up with two parents. Nearly two-thirds of black children are now born to single mothers, up from one-fifth in 1960.This is, of course, a social disaster. By that, I don't mean that single parenthood inevitably fails. It doesn't. Plenty of children will not only survive, they will thrive, because they have a loving and committed parent. One good parent is better than two lousy parents. But two good parents are better than one. They typically have more money. In 1991 median family income for black married couples was $33,300; for a single mother, median income was $11,400. Parenting is also as trying as it is joyous. Two bodies simply improve the chances of success.What's most disastrous about present trends is the explosion of unwed teenage mothers. One-fifth of all black children are now born to unwed teens. These children of children start life with the odds against them. Their parents haven't developed job skills. Many aren't ready for the time-consuming burdens of parenting. Teenagers want to have fun, and although children are fun, raising them is no party. Our schools and social institutions can't compensate for children born before their time.We resist talking about these issues. Every discussion risks slipping into a debate about racism, which - for different reasons - makes both blacks and whites seethe. Whites tend to think that blacks resort too easily to racism as an explanation for any difficult problem; blacks tend to think that whites can never understand the barriers they face. All this plays to the worst racial stereotypes on both sides of the color line. But there's also another cause of our mutual reluctance, and it is that no one really knows what to do.As the Newsweek story made clear, we don't understand why black families have fared so badly. The causes seem to be a mixture of general societal trends (earlier and easier sex, less stigma to unwed motherhood), economic changes (loss of well-paying factory jobs for black men) and the family patterns of American black culture.

670,"A Cautious Look at Electric Utilities; Once Safe and Dependable, They Are Now Hotbeds of Turmoil and Uncertainty. If you picked `c' you are right. One of the oddities of investing is that as the price of a stock goes down, the yield on the stock gets better.For example, if Zilch Power & Light Co. pays a $1 a year dividend, and the stock sells for $25, you are getting a yield of 4 percent. But let the stock sink to $12.50 a share and you are getting an 8 percent yield.Now, an 8 percent yield looks pretty good these days and, indeed, so does any stock that is selling for half the price of only 11 months ago. Thus, a lot of investors must be looking at the recent carnage in utility stocks and utility funds and wondering if it is time to go bargain hunting.Unfortunately, there's no easy answer. Electric utility stocks, once safe, dependable and boring, have become hotbeds of turmoil and uncertainty. Their sensitivity to changes in interest rates is only part of the story.Vast changes are taking place in the electricity business and the utilities, which once enjoyed a monopoly status, apparently will be forced to compete for business in a free-wheeling competitive environment that could hurt the value of their generating plants, their companies and their stock prices.",0,1.0,0.0,298
671,"Ontario's 30% Tax-Cut Plan Gets Lukewarm Reception --- Premier Hopes to Stimulate The Economy, but Voters Aren't Convinced. AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalCanada's most populous province must reduce its chronic deficits, Mr. Harris argues, or risk being left behind as other provinces already have moved to balance their budgets.Now Mr. Harris is moving ahead with his promised 30% income-tax cut. ""We want to stimulate the economy with consumer spending"" and by ""rewarding initiative,"" he says. The revenue lost because of the tax cut will return to the government's coffers through ""increased spending, more jobs and more sales taxes,"" he believes.But is it really so simple? Can the government cut taxes and reduce spending simultaneously, without triggering a recession? And if the government goes along with its plans, including eliminating 13,000 public-sector jobs, will the economy create new jobs?Although some economists believe the conservative government's plans are achievable, voters aren't so sure.

672,"Smoking-Related Medical Care In '93 Estimated at $50 Billion; Costs More Than Doubled in 5 Years, CDC Study Says. Smoking-related illnesses cost Americans about $50 billion for medical treatment last year, or the equivalent of a $2.06 tax on a pack of cigarettes, according to a study released yesterday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC said the medical costs of smoking had more than doubled since 1988. Much of the increase is attributable to medical inflation and to the growing proportion of older people whose smoking habits are catching up with them, said Thomas Novotny, coauthor of the study and an assistant dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. ""This is the rock-bottom estimate of the cost of smoking,"" he said.Researchers took the total U.S. expenditure on five ""smoking-related medical conditions"" - heart disease, emphysema, arteriosclerosis, stroke and cancer - and determined the amount of each attributable to smoking alone. They then calculated the costs of prescription drugs, hospitalization, physician care and home health care to treat those illnesses.The total does not include, Novotny said, the cost of treating burns caused by cigarette-related accidents or the special medical needs of some babies born to smoking mothers. The study comes at a politically important time as Congress considers hefty cigarette tax increases to pay for health care reform. Four committees - two in the House and two in the Senate - have passed bills that would increase the current federal tax on cigarettes from 24 cents to as much as $2 a pack.House and Senate leaders are attempting to meld the measures into single bills to be debated on the House and Senate floors.",0,1.0,0.0,1329

The Fed staff said that some bad checks won't be returned to the banks that cashed them in time to meet the deadline, but that the proposed improvements would reduce that number.The proposal calls for Federal Reserve Banks to process any returned check and send it directly to the bank on which it was drawn.

AT A TIME when the country's biggest companies are abruptly laying off longtime employees by the thousands, it's not surprising that Americans' thinking about jobs and job loyalty is changing. Labor Day this year is distinguished by the realization that the present churning in the job market is not temporary but probably will continue.For most of the past half-century, large corporations provided much of the middle class with a high degree of security - including a tacit promise that the employee who performed well would stay on the payroll until retirement. In the past decade's epidemic of mergers, reorganizations and productivity drives, that promise has all but vanished. It's uncertainty rather than actual unemployment that is generating the growing sense of insecurity in this country.Unemployment is, fortunately, falling. The great American job- creating machine, stuck in neutral for several years, is now back at work.

The result was that unemployment came down by a million, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.6 percent of the labor force in August 1992 to 6.7 percent last month.That's a remarkable achievement and reassuring. So why do consumer surveys continue to show high levels of uneasiness and caution?Part of it is that earnings aren't moving much.

Its job is like that of an old-time telegraph operator who waits for messages to arrive and then passes them on to their intended recipient.Inside the body, the mechanism enables cells to communicate by releasing hormones that act on other cells to trigger them into action; this helps the cells of tissues to work together and in coordination with other parts of the body. Also, the mechanism operates in the nerve endings of the eyes, nose and mouth so that these specialized cells can respond to signals from the outside world that give rise to images, smells and flavors.Sharing the $954,000 award are Alfred G.

694,"Long and Short of Poverty Trends. There's good news and bad news for the Reagan administration in the poverty statistics for 1984, published Tuesday by the Census Bureau.The good news is that after increasing steadily during the administration's first three years until the number of poor reached a post-1965 high, poverty has begun to decline. The economic recovery of 1983-84 brought greater prosperity to many of the poor as well as to most everyone else. As a result, about 1.8 million people moved above the poverty line. Moreover, the improvement was broad-based, with the black poor in particular showing significant gains. At least for the time being, this accomplishment should quiet those who have criticized ""Reaganomics"" as unfair to the less well-off.The bad news is that even after a period of robust economic growth, the Reagan administration so far still has wound up with more people in poverty than at any time since 1966 (except, of course, for its own time in office). The nearly one-percentage-point reduction last year -- from 15.3% to 14.4% of the population -- is nothing to sneeze at. However, it's not unprecedented and is just about the same amount by which the poverty rolls had been rising annually. More improvement may yet come, but it will be increasingly difficult.The reason is that many of the remaining poor fall into groups that have typically had above-average rates of poverty.

The Wall Street Journal OnlineA LATE POP by General Motors kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average from sinking into negative territory for 2005.Drifting lower all day, the blue-chip average briefly dipped into the red for the year. But a last-minute surge by GM, one of 30 Dow industrial stocks, helped the average trim its losses just before the close. The auto maker's stock gained 2.9% thanks to a report that it is considering giving a board seat to Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., which has been buying GM shares and advocating a corporate makeover to invigorate the stock.Analysts said the overall decline by stocks was a carry-over from a selloff that began in late trading Tuesday, when investors unloaded stocks after a big rally.

NEW YORK -- The hairy beast of inflation, hunted to the brink of extinction in the broader economy, has taken refuge in the Ivory Tower.Even while prices on everything from clothing to computer chips steadily decline, the cost of getting an education continues to rise, whether the sought-after institution is a private Ivy League college, a public university or a popular preschool.In recent weeks, private universities have been announcing tuition for the 1999-2000 academic year, and the increases -- which range between 3% and 5% -- are more than double the annual rate of inflation. Private grade schools and preschools are boosting tuition as much as 7%. Public universities, which depend on state legislation to determine tuition, won't release new fees until the summer. However, previous increases have tended to be slightly lower than private-school increases, but still above inflation.To hear some schools tell it, students should be happy that the increases aren't higher. ""The actual cost of a Harvard education is close to $48,000 per year,"" lamented Harvard University when it announced a few weeks ago that next fall's fees will rise 3.3% to $32,164.

Bill Clinton did his best to look attentive at his economic summit yesterday, but to really understand what was going on the President-elect would have needed earphones with instant translation. How else could he, or anyone else, make sense of this economic tower of babble?That may seem harsh, but is there a theme we're missing here other than that the country's a mess and Mr. Clinton plans to do something about it? Opening the two-day conference, Mr. Clinton dusted off his campaign stump speech, which may have been only prudent since no conclave of 300 people is ever going to be more than a giant bull session. Some in the Clinton camp have thought this was a dumb idea from the start, which is at least reassuring. Their least-awful solution has been to make the event a kind of economic ""Oprah,"" in which designees from all sides of the Clinton coalition get to explain how they feel about the economy.So we have economist Allen Sinai, who supports a cut in the capital gains tax, communing with MIT Keynesian Robert Solow, who wants to raise virtually every tax known to man. David Osborne, the ""reinventing government"" author, gets to schmooze with Ken Geiger of the teachers' unions, which think public schools with 50% drop-out rates deserve more money. Perhaps they'll all have a mind meld.Assorted small-business owners (such as the trendy folk at neo-prep clothier J. Crew), who are supposed to create all sorts of ""high-wage jobs,"" get to mingle with Jessica Tuchman Mathews, who would saddle those same owners with new environmental rules that cost jobs. Our favorite name on the summit list, we have to admit, is Chief Wilma Mankiller, representing the ""Cherokee Nation,"" though we hope not a feminist economic priority.Our own view, since Mr. Clinton is asking, is that the U.S. is not in fact in any economic crisis. The economy is now expanding, more slowly than we'd like, but enough so that any ""short-term"" stimulus would be counterproductive. If there is an economic emergency now, it's in Japan and Germany, which are both in recession and have long-term structural problems. Far from beating our brains out, Japan in particular might soon be asking the Clinton administration for financial help.",0,1.0,0.0,1985

Franklin Foer, armed with a terrific idea, took six months off from his job as a staff writer at the New Republic to tour the soccer capitals of the world. He set out to observe soccer as a way to understand the consequences of globalization -- the increasing interdependence of the world's nations -- by studying a sport in which ""national borders and national identities had been swept into the dustbin of soccer history."" The result is a travelogue full of important insights into both cultural change and persistence.Foer returned from this global tour convinced that globalization has not and will not soon wipe away local institutions and cultures. On the contrary, he suspects that the opposite has happened: In response to the threat of global integration, local entities have launched counterattacks that are successful but ""not always in such a good way."" Local blood feuds and corruption have proved to be remarkably persistent. So persistent, in fact, that Foer believes that globalization is not likely to deliver on the promise of a more humane world order that some of its proponents anticipate. That would require a liberal nationalism, a development necessary ""to blunt the return of tribalism."" Soccer, at its best, shows how this might work. For Foer, the sport demonstrates that ""you could love your country -- even consider it a superior group -- without desiring to dominate other groups or closing yourself off to foreign impulses.""Regarding the ""not so good ways"" that locals respond to globalism, Foer found much to worry about. The world of soccer can be quite ugly. In Serbia, fans of Red Star Belgrade became, as he puts it, ""Milosevic's shock troops, the most active agents of ethnic cleansing, highly efficient practitioners of genocide."" The ""unfinished fight over the Protestant Reformation"" is kept alive in the stands in Glasgow. And, at least as he reports it, Margaret Thatcher was not far off the mark when she said that the hooliganism that emerged in soccer during the 1980s was ""a disgrace to civilized society.""Foer argues that the gruesome antisocial fan behavior that occurs when soccer is at its worst is counterbalanced in other places where the sport plays a role in creating a more humane order. The most interesting and unlikely of these is Iran. During the Islamic Revolution of 1979, women were prohibited from attending soccer games at Tehran's 120,000-seat stadium. But, as Foer tells it, this banning never fully took effect, with some women sneaking into the facility dressed in men's clothes. Pressed by female soccer fans, the ruling Iranian clergy issued a new fatwa in 1987 that allowed women to watch games on television, though the ban on attendance remained in place.This compromise could not survive the jubilation that followed the Iranian national team's successful capture of a World Cup berth in 1997. The team itself was at least to some extent a participant in the liberal global order: Its coach was a Brazilian who wore a necktie, an accessory that the ruling clergy considered a European imposition. But the victory celebration and its aftermath were even more important. Foer reports that many of the younger celebrants were women, some of whom danced with uncovered heads. Further, at the official celebration at the stadium, when women were denied entrance they mounted a demonstration. They shouted, ""Aren't we part of this nation? We want to celebrate too. We aren't ants."" Ultimately they broke through the police barriers and joined the mass victory party. Foer compares this ""football revolution"" to the Boston Tea Party. He notes that the event will ""go down as the moment when the people first realized that they could challenge their tyrannical rulers."" As the United States looks for ways to encourage liberalism within Islam, an event such as this deserves attention. Its impact suggests that Paul Wolfowitz, if no one else, should read this account.",0,1.0,0.0,504

He said federal prosecutors have focused on his efforts to secure a defense contract for a company that later made improper contributions to his campaign and on certain gratuities he received, including half a dozen free trips on corporate aircraft.""When stripped to its essence, the charge is the congressman forgot to reimburse people for plane rides back to his district or for stays at their beach house or for a night and dinner at a hotel,"" said a statement released by McDade.While the RICO statute has been used against numerous public officials, few members of Congress have been charged with RICO violations, according to the Justice Department. The RICO, or Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, often used in organized crime, terrorism and drug cases, is designed to attack a pattern of criminal conduct.According to sources close to McDade, the federal investigation has centered on McDade's ties to United ChemCon, a company with a plant in McDade's congressional district. The Wall Street Journal disclosed in 1988 that the FBI was investigating whether McDade violated election or bribery laws by accepting more than $45,000 in campaign contributions and speaking fees from United ChemCon officials. The FBI was also looking into McDade's acceptance of a free beach house and free plane trips from United ChemCon.",0,1.0,0.0,4596
747,"Bond Market Braces for Rally's End --- Investors Stand in Precarious Position as Looming Cutback in Fed Purchases May Deal Blow to Funds. Smart analysts have been warning for years that the bottom could fall out of the surging bond market.They were wrong. Bond yields went to unprecedented lows, pushing bond prices to unprecedented highs, and they just kept going. The weak economy, little inflation and exceptional Federal Reserve policies took bonds to unnatural levels.But nothing lasts forever. At some point, the economy will become more normal and yields will rise to more natural levels. Existing bonds with their lower yields will fall in value. Bond-fund investors will lose money.Many bond-fund managers think the process has finally begun. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 2.7% from about 1.6% in early May. Treasury-bond funds have fallen in value. Money managers have begun selling funds holding Treasurys and other high-grade bonds.The spark for this is the Fed's plan to start trimming its $85 billion in monthly bond-buying stimulus.

Author: Andy KesslerWhat's wrong with Wall Street? I don't mean the painfully slow and dreadful new Oliver Stone movie. I mean the real Wall Street. The stock market has been on a tear this month and is up a few percentage points for the year. But the stocks of most Wall Street firms are actually down close to 15% for the year.It wasn't supposed to be this way. The Federal Reserve's near-zero interest rate policy makes it almost impossible for Wall Street not to make money by borrowing at next to nothing and buying anything, especially Treasury bonds. This gives banks easy profits and the wiggle room to write off the toxic mortgage assets that never got cleared out.While most firms won't release earnings for another three or four weeks, Jefferies investment bank set off air raid sirens last week by announcing disappointing earnings, which CEO Richard Handler blamed on ""painfully slow trading."" And there's more trouble down the road.One obvious problem is that the yield curve has flattened. While short-term rates are near zero, Ben Bernanke's Fed, via quantitative easing, has been working furiously to lower long-term mortgage rates. In January, Wall Street could borrow in the short-term market at 0.15% and buy 10-year bonds paying close to 4%. Today they can still borrow cheap at 0.14%--but 10-year bonds are only paying 2.6%.

WASHINGTON -- Sluggish business hiring in September suggests the economy is growing a bit more slowly, although the drop in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.4% is a reminder that the economy is still very healthy.The Labor Department's employment report was viewed by many economists as convincing evidence that earlier fears of an overheating economy were misplaced. ""The economy is slowing, not dramatically, but there is some modest slowing,"" said John Hagens of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.Still, there were enough conflicting signals in the report to allow Republicans to celebrate the continued health of the economy while Wall Street concluded that growth is tapering off and, therefore, that inflation and sharply higher interest rates aren't as much of a threat.Investors displayed their relief by pushing up stock and bond prices sharply, allowing interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds to fall to the lowest level in nearly six months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.50 points, closing at 2150.25. ""The market read it correctly,"" said Milton Hudson, economist for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. ""I think we're headed for a soft landing. This gives us a glimmer of hope.""The Labor Department said non-farm payrolls grew by 255,000 in September.

NEW YORK -- Some of the best long-term records in the investment business belong to hedge fund managers, the gunslingers of Wall Street. But this year only a few are beating the market, and a fair number are losing money.Hedge fund managers play both sides of the investment street. Catering to pension funds and wealthy individuals, the hedge funds ""go long,"" buying stocks as conventional money managers do. They also ""go short,"" making bets that certain stocks will decline.It's a two-pronged approach rarely seen in the mutual fund arena, the small investor's domain. And it's no sure thing. Although the strategy is supposed to help hedge against the risk of a big market move in either direction, many of these ""smart money"" funds lately have been taking a lot of lumps.Pure short-sellers are having a dreadful year, with the major stock-market averages up roughly 13%. Many heavily shorted stocks, far from declining, have risen 20% or more. Hedge fund managers aren't immune to the carnage. ""I'm more long than short, but my shorts are killing me,"" says Walter Kass, who runs CK Partners, a New York hedge fund.Managing to sidestep the damage were the hedge funds that either stayed mainly long or deployed exotic investment strategies. Essex Performance Fund was up about 20% in January and February, using a blend of 145% long and 25% short.

Some valid questions may indeed be raised about the design and efficiency of our aid program for Russia. Certainly, the rhetoric of ""shock therapy,"" ""irreversible change"" and ""strategic partnership,"" originally used to sell Russian reform to the American public was naively romantic. But Krauthammer's proposal to disengage U.S. assistance is misguided.Russia is not Cuba or North Korea. A starvation strategy of noncooperation cannot possibly work with Russia. It is too important strategically and has too many nuclear warheads. Active, constructive engagement with Russia is the only responsible option. It is also the best way to address Krauthammer's warning that Russia will follow China's nakedly authoritarian path.Engagement must be recognized for what it is. It is not a magic wand. Nor is it a marriage vow. Understood correctly, it should be a strategy of pragmatic cooperation based on expanding spheres of mutual interest.Foreign aid to the post-Communist countries, including Russia, has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It is a bag of tactical interventions and subventions -- know-how and cash -- to promote desirable political and economic developments. Admittedly, there is more art than science to foreign aid, but over the years we have also learned what does and does not work. For example, trying to ""buy"" elections usually backfires. Trying to impose textbook political and economic models on non-textbook conditions is unwise. Pushing radical reform while ignoring its social consequences (such as unemployment) also is a bad idea, especially if the unemployed get to vote.Krauthammer argues that it is simply not in our national interest to help the Russians with their economic travails. Yeltsin, the butcher of Chechnya, has turned out to be a bad guy, so why support him? On the other hand, should Yeltsin lose in next June's presidential election -- a distinct possibility -- it would be better for us if his likely neo-communist successor, Gennady Zyuganov, faced a crippled economy.",0,0.6675,0.3325,3306

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 16 UOExtension of the income tax surcharge beyond its expiration date next summer will not adversely affect consumer spending, economists at the University of Michigan were told Friday.UIMost consumers either do not know that Congress made the tax increase a temporary measure, or believe that the surtax will be extended,U said Prof. George Katona, an economist and psychologist at the university.Katona recalled that when the tax went into effect last summer it did not have a dampening effect hoped for because it came at a time when large wage increases were frequent and when expectations of further wage increases were strong.There was some slowing of consumer demand in anticipation of the boost, he noted, bul it was quickly overcome after the tax became a reality since the additional payments were only small extra deductions from weekly paychecks.Now, consumers have become accustomed to the tax and still are optimistic over future salary boosts, the economist said.

WASHINGTON -- Prospects dimmed significantly for President Bush's proposed dividend-tax repeal, after four pivotal senators put in writing that they wouldn't support a tax-cut package larger than $350 billion.Unless the White House can change their minds or win over other allies, the elimination of dividend taxes for stockholders -- the centerpiece of the administration's 10-year, $725 billion economic plan -- is in jeopardy.Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine and George Voinovich of Ohio, and Democratic Sens. Max Baucus of Montana and John Breaux of Louisiana, sent a letter yesterday to Senate leaders committing to the 10-year $350 billion cap. The four centrists were considered crucial swing votes for Mr. Bush.The two Republican senators defected despite heavy lobbying by administration officials. Neither was inclined to abandon Mr. Bush on the eve of war, but concerns about the growing budget deficit proved to be stronger. The commitments by Sens. Breaux and Baucus are also significant because the two were the leading Democratic supporters of Mr. Bush's 2001 tax package. ""It's a breakthrough for those of us who are concerned about the debt,"" Mr. Baucus said.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said that if he is limited to crafting a $350 billion package, Mr. Bush's dividends component -- which carries a 10-year price tag of nearly $400 billion -- likely would be dropped.

J( )AI The U 'ashington Tost, Times Herald (1959- /973); Feb I 1, 1969;From 1955 to 1960 the consumer price index rose approximately ten points. From 1961 to 1965 it rose by 5.5 points. During the first period there was a sharp increase in wholesale prices. During the second period these were stable. During the earlier period unemployment was between 4.1 and 6.8 per cent. The difference between the two periods, some effects undeniably associated with the small differences in the level of employment, was that between 1961 and 1965 the Kennedy-Johnson Administrations had considerable success in holding wage increases in the organized sector of the economy within the amounts that could be afforded by productivity gains and in enforcing the appropriate price stability. This was the policy of the guideposts. No such policy was in effect before 1961. After 1965 it succumbed to the fiscal pressures of the Vietnam war, and, quite possibly, to a lessened sense of"" the importance of the policy. Recent Economic Reports have spoken rather ambiguously of the wickedness of any interference with free markets by price control and the absolute necessity of some interference to insure price stability.I have ncr-wish to give Mr. Nixon advice on economics. Like all Presidents he will have more of this than he can use. But I see no reason to spare you. You should know, as your recent editorial on the subject sadly fails to show, that in dispensing with the guideposts, or something similar, he is sacrificing his only chance for reconciling price stability with high employment. The American economy, whatever wishful analysis there may be to the contrary, is not stable at or near full employment. Wages will always shove up prices and prices will always pull up wages and this spiral will revolve for Republicans and Democrats alike. Moveover it has been the experience of virtually every other major industrial country that some machinery for wage and price restraint Is the only alternative to inflation of heavy unemployment.In this connection it should be observed that whoever gave the new President that line about relying on UIfine-tuningU the economy with monetary and fiscal measures was guilty of a shameless snow job. UIFine-tuningU the American economy is like fine-tuning a football crowd or a speech by Dirksen. If this kind of finesse could combine high employment and price stability some country would have learned the secret by now.Before winter returns again, faced with a further increase in prices and a bad commodity balance, Mr. Nixon, one can predict with absolute certainty, will be pleading for wage and prioe restraint. That is to say he will have reinstituted the guideposts without the guidance.",0,1.0,0.0,3205

792,"Census Says Hispanics Made Economic Gains;Per Capita Income Trails Blacks' and Whites'. America's burgeoning Hispanic community is a population both at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder and one experiencing a measure of rapid economic upward mobility, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.On the one hand, the combined income of Hispanic households increased nearly 70 percent, largely as a result of rapid population growth since the early 1980s. The figures underscore the greatly heightened purchasing power and presence of the Hispanic population in this country. The median income of Hispanic households grew by 9 percent since 1983.At the same time, Hispanics continue to suffer disproportionately from poverty and low educational attainment, according to the report. Hispanic per capita income continues to be below that of both blacks and whites.Taken together, the figures point to a diverse population, both economically and socially, with Puerto Ricans much more likely to be poor and live in households headed by females, and Cubans more likely than other Hispanic populations to earn more than $50,000 a year.""The Hispanic population is now a very large, significant presence, particularly in certain areas of the country,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute. ""There are roughly as many Hispanics in the country today as there were blacks in 1970. So we're talking about a sizable presence.""",0,1.0,0.0,2400

LINTHICUM, Md. -- Ciena Corp. agreed to acquire ONI Systems Corp. in an $850 million stock deal, creating a powerhouse in optical-networking equipment and possibly sparking further industry consolidation.Hugh Martin, ONI's chairman, president and chief executive, said the companies are ""a perfect match,"" since Ciena specializes in equipment for long-haul networks while ONI provides gear for metropolitan networks. Mr. Martin said he initiated the deal, partly because ONI's telecommunications-carrier customers had expressed ""some concern about breadth of product line"" and customer support from ONI as a stand-alone company.Although Ciena has increased its market share over the past year, the Linthicum, Md., company -- like its competitors -- has been hit hard by plummeting demand for networking gear, as telecommunications carriers rein in spending or struggle to stay in business. Ciena recently warned of sharply falling revenue and a substantial loss for its fiscal first quarter, ended Jan. 31.Ciena's top competitors include Nortel Networks Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Alcatel SA and others.Demand for metropolitan network equipment, however, ""is holding up much better than the long-haul"" network segment, said Gary Smith, Ciena's president and chief executive.

NEW YORK -- Are investors fighting the last war?In the past week's tumult, investors have favored the same sectors of the stock market that did well during the 1970s oil-price shocks and pummeled most of the same losers, according to Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., investment research firm.But a minority of investment strategists say that the market may have learned too well from the inflationary jolts of 1973-74 and 1979-80. In particular, they suggest that investors may be acting on expectations about inflation and interest rates that aren't justified by the current limping economy.The most obvious differences that set today apart, says Richard Hoey, U.S. chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is that ""those two oil shocks came when the economy was closer to boom levels"" and inflation was already a problem. The result in 1973-74 was ""an inflation psychology that fed on itself,"" as businesses stocked up inventories and consumers spent like there was no tomorrow. In 1979-80, the Federal Reserve fought back with a sudden and very aggressive monetary tightening that sent interest rates into the stratosphere.Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, investors seem to be betting that soaring inflation and interest rates are going to be big problems again.",0,1.0,0.0,1403

802,"California Vote Brings Windfall For Stem Cells. REPUBLICANS may have won significant victories across the country in Tuesday's elections, but California voters registered a strong dissent with Bush-administration policy by approving vastly expanded state funding for medical research involving embryonic stem cells.The passage of California's Proposition 71, supported by nearly 60% of the state's voters, appears likely to herald a new era in U.S. stem-cell research. Restrictions on federal funding of the work have led to worries that the U.S. may be lagging behind in the nascent field of ""regenerative medicine,"" so called because of hopes that stem cells might be useful in treating conditions such as paralyzing spinal injuries, diabetes or Parkinson's disease.Without question, Prop. 71 represents a financial windfall to embryonic stem-cell research. The measure, now enshrined in the California Constitution, sets aside $350 million a year for the work during the next decade or so, up to a total of $3 billion. That sum dwarfs the $25 million the federal National Institutes of Health allocated to embryonic stem-cell grants last year and is three times as much as what defeated Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry vowed to provide in federal funding.Yet implementing the measure will raise a variety of new challenges, not least the question of whether the state can afford to devote so much money to basic research that might not yield medical or financial returns for a decade or more. During the past several years, California has consistently run the largest budget deficits in the nation, a fiscal gap it has temporarily plugged only by selling billions of dollars' of new bonds. Prop. 71, which will be funded by bond sales, could cost the state as much as $6 billion during the next 30 years.It is unclear exactly how the new California Institute of Regenerative Medicine mandated by Prop. 71 will allocate the new research funds, and whether the state stands to benefit financially if the research leads to commercial medical therapies. While Prop. 71's approval may draw bright medical researchers and fresh biotechnology investment to California, it also may spur other states to pass similar measures in order to level the playing field.",0,1.0,0.0,3964

As one of the region's most prosperous jurisdictions, Arlington was well positioned to ride out the recession, they said.But with the county entering a fifth consecutive budget season facing a large revenue shortfall, that brand of optimism has begun to wane. Increasingly, county officials are acknowledging that they face a long-term case of the fiscal blahs, in which annual increases in the property tax rate and mild program cuts will continue to be the rule.""There is going to be no great recovery from the recession, which we've been counting on for several years,"" said Mark Jinks, the county's director of management and finance.

804,"Where the Dollar's Still King. New York, New York, it's a helluva town -- prices go up and they never come down. Once again, inflation is skyrocketing in New York City. Witness the sharp price jumps over the past several years in real estate (monthly residential rents rose a record 8.3% in the last year alone, despite a nationwide downturn), hotel rooms (at the new Plaza, rates start at $775 a night), cab and commuting fares, Broadway shows (tickets for ""Young Frankenstein,"" the new Mel Brooks musical, top out at $450 for some performances), museum admissions ($20 at Museum of Modern Art) and even movie tickets (the Ziegfeld charged $25 for a reserved seat for ""Dreamgirls"" last year).You might think that the same is true for restaurants. But when we look at the numbers from our 2008 New York Restaurant Survey, dining out appears to be one of New York's last remaining affordable pleasures. Prices are holding steady at everyday restaurants, real deals (a la $24 lunches) can be found all over town, and more neighborhoods now offer a bounty of restaurants that give good quality at reasonable prices. Overall, the rate of inflation in New York City dining costs has been risen just 0.97% since 9/11 -- barely a third of the Consumer Price Index.The New York restaurant industry is riding a bull market, fueled in part by the rise of the ""brand name"" chef -- call it chef culture. Even as restaurant rents hit the $75,000-a-month stratosphere, these top chefs and their partners are opening new venues all over town. With the new trend toward less formal dining, they may not be shelling out as much for expensive china and crystal stemware, but their costs are high: They want to cook with the best organic or seasonal ingredients, hire cutting-edge designers for eye-grabbing decor, and nab a spot in the hottest neighborhoods.As a result, there has been a high rate of inflation at these best- in-class venues. Since 9/11, the average meal cost at the restaurants on our 20 Most Expensive list has jumped to $143.06 from $84.85 -- 11.6% a year. The arrival of super expensive restaurants like Masa ($485) and Per Se ($301) contributed to this sea change, but even without these newcomers, inflation at top-of-the-line places is roughly 5%.Among all New York restaurants, however, the average cost of a meal has risen only three cents since last year's survey -- to $39.46 from $39.43, a barely perceptible 0.1% This is thanks to a slew of inexpensive newcomers that keep the cost average steady. New York might be the most expensive city in America for dining out, but for average meal cost it's far behind Paris ($71.51), Tokyo ($73.11) and London ($78.57).",0,1.0,0.0,1738
805,"Long Recovery For the Dollar Called Doubtful --- Currency Stages Big Rally On U.S. Trade Report, But Skepticism Remains. Concern about a steep fall of the dollar to new lows was relieved by the surprisingly big improvement in U.S. trade reported Friday. A sustained recovery of the dollar still remains doubtful, however, in the view of currency traders and economists.The drop in the November trade deficit to $13.22 billion from the record $17.63 billion the previous month came as a shocker to the foreign exchange market. Economists' forecasts placed the deficit around $15 billion and market rumors had the gap running as high as $20 billion. Wednesday's wave of coordinated central bank purchases of the dollar and an announcement of a U.S.-Japanese pact aimed at aiding further intervention led some market participants to conclude that even Washington and Tokyo were expecting a bad number.So when the figure was reported Friday, the dollar quickly soared 3.9% to 131 Japanese yen, where it stood in late New York dealings, up from 126.05 Thursday. The dollar climbed 3.7% to 1.6885 West German marks from 1.6290.

The competition is so brutal, the cost pressures so unforgiving and the regulatory atmosphere so unpredictable, nobody can fathom what's coming -- even if the stock market calms down.The first lesson, industry officials say, is that health care stocks don't rise and fall in tandem. Instead, there are dozens of sub-sectors with conflicting interests in the business of ""managed care"" -- the buzzword for insurers' attempts to limit health costs by controlling services.Investors seeking quick riches in health care ""had better think again,"" mutual fund research company Morningstar Inc. said in a February report.

So one week after The Deal, who are the winners and losers?If the stock market is any guide, one obvious winner in the announced megamerger of America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. is Time Warner itself, which obtained a stunning 70% merger premium to its then-prevailing stock price. The transaction was valued at about $160 billion when announced, but the decline in AOL's stock reduced the value to a current price of $138 billion.In some respects, that was completely expected, and the one-day delay before AOL's decline -- now standing at about 18% -- was largely driven by the early euphoria over the deal. But what also took place was a massive transfer of value from AOL shareholders to Time Warner shareholders, so a decline in AOL was inevitable, points out one media investment banker. Time Warner's shares ended up 25% for the week, a very respectable showing.Though it was precedent-setting in many respects, from a financial point of view the transaction was a typical late '90s deal: a fast-growing upstart with a high-multiple stock -- WorldCom Inc., Qwest Communications International Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. -- using its currency to buy a more-established company with hard assets. Thus, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications to form MCI WorldCom Inc. (and is now buying Sprint Corp.), Qwest is acquiring U S West Inc., and Global Crossing acquired Frontier Corp. Those deals all deflated the multiples of the buyers.Then, later in the week Charles Schwab Corp., the online brokerage behemoth that has an Internet-like multiple compared with other financials, said it would pay $2.7 billion in stock to buy blue-blooded U.S. Trust Corp.

NEW YORK -- In the perennial pursuit of the American dream -- an affordable home -- home buyers have been snapping up adjustable-rate mortgages.But just as ardently, investors are shying away from securities backed by adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. From the investors' point of view, the home buyers are getting too good a deal.And that could mean bad news down the line for home buyers. While consumers are already being forced to bend somewhat, mortgage market participants say they may have to accept a harsher jolt: higher interest rates and less restrictive interest-rate ""caps,"" or limits.Adjustable-rate mortgages account for about two-thirds of all new mortgages and are credited with having sheltered housing from the higher interest rates that have prevailed in the capital markets. Securities firms made a fortune turning fixed-rate mortgages into securities and selling them to investors, and in the process they helped bail out hard-pressed thrifts and other mortgage lenders. Now they would like to do the same with adjustable-rate mortgages.At the moment, success seems remote. Investors say adjustable-rate mortgages simply aren't all that adjustable. Most of those available limit the yearly rate adjustments to 1% to 2%, and set a lifetime, or maximum, cap on total increases at five to 7.5 percentage points.

819,"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Beyond Argentina. Anyone who tires of thinking about the mammoth Latin American debt problem ought to keep in mind that, for better or worse, the United States government and United States banks are going to be held responsible for how this thing comes out. If Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, or even Mexico descend toward political and economic anarchy, both the U.S. political interests and the banks' financial interests will be damaged -- in the long run probably severely so.We make these remarks against a backdrop of Argentina speeding toward crisis on the wings of inflation estimated by some now at more than 104,000% and with debt talks resuming in New York tomorrow between Mexico and its bank creditors. There were reports Wednesday out of the Madrid International Monetary Conference that the World Bank, IMF and Japanese banks had agreed to put up $5.5 billion for Mexico. Presumably some of that could be used to reduce debt principal, in line with the Brady Plan. Debt spokesmen for Mexico and Citibank said the commitment could produce rapid progress.We hope that's true. The U.S. banks no doubt have to pursue their interests in this matter as they see them, but we've worried for some time that the banks, the international institutions, and some parts of the U.S. government often can't see the forest for the trees in this issue. Whatever any particular set of numbers looks like for the Americans, the U.S. simply can't fail to produce a positive political outcome for the Latin continent. That is the responsibility of leadership that currently rests on the United States, and if the U.S. can't produce that leadership, the Latins and other countries as well will look for someone who can -- the Japanese, if we're lucky, or the Cubans or the drug lords or home-grown demagogues.Which brings us specifically to the role, or non-role, of the U.S. administration in this process. Suffice it to say that Latin American policy under George Bush and in the late stages of the Reagan administration hardly has been crowned with success. What little policy the U.S. has is mostly made at Treasury, which is charged with responsibilities for keeping Latin debt problems under some semblance of control. It hardly can be said that Treasury has been succeeding.Brazil may be forced to declare another debt-service moratorium soon, according to banking circles, and that will do nothing to improve the deteriorating political situation in that country. Venezuela is hard pressed. Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari is under heavy political pressure to come up with a good deal with the banks.

NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut could help step up the pace of mergers and acquisitions in early 2001.The momentum that generated eight straight record years for M&A expansion began to falter in the second half of 2000 because of stock-market gyrations and a correction in valuations that damaged the purchasing power of potential acquirers.

[para] For some people who thought they had taken care of everything, the answer may be riding on another question: Is your retirement community secure? [para] Anne Bradt, 83, said she and fellow residents thought they had bought themselves worry-free retirements when they put down hundreds of thousands of dollars -- upwards of $900,000 each -- to move into Sherburne Commons in Nantucket, Mass. Then, a year ago, the nonprofit company that runs the place sought bankruptcy protection. Food service was cut to one meal a day. Activities such as dance and music disappeared, along with the activities director and other members of the staff. Residents could still pull a cord if they needed emergency help in the shower, but they would have to pay extra for the lifeline, and the person answering the call would no longer be on the premises.[para] Bradt's life became caught up in a complex legal proceeding, with her entire deposit at risk. [para] ""It's been one year of absolute hell,"" Bradt said. ""It's taken its toll physically and mentally."" The recession and the real estate crisis have raised new concerns for people who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, as much money as it might take to buy a home, just to enter retirement communities. The deposits typically earn seniors the privilege of moving in; they do not confer any ownership in the real estate, and they are in addition to monthly fees that can total thousands of dollars.In theory, residents can reclaim the money when they move out, or their heirs can recoup it when they die. But the model can break down when the communities' economic assumptions prove too optimistic.The October bankruptcy filing of another firm -- Erickson Retirement Communities, a major developer and manager of campuses for senior citizens -- casts a spotlight on the risks.Erickson has been a leader in the world of ""continuing care retirement communities"" -- CCRCs -- which offer independent living, assisted living and nursing home care. In the Washington area, Erickson communities include Riderwood in Silver Spring and Greenspring in Springfield. People move in while they are still able to live independently, hoping it will be their last major move. One of the main advantages is that seniors can stay in the same community as their health deteriorates, and couples can avoid being separated in their declining years.For some Erickson residents, including early occupants of the Ashby Ponds development in Ashburn, it may not work out that way.

827,"All Quiet on the Eastern Front?. The United States in recent months has been preoccupied with the Middle East and with the near-term crisis posed by North Korea's announcement that it has nuclear weapons. But there are other long- term developments taking place that will change the political landscape of Asia in ways that will ultimately weaken U.S. influence there. Policy makers in Washington seem scarcely to have noticed, much less arrived at a long-term strategy for dealing with these developments.Since 1945, East Asia has never had the internal cohesion or organization of Europe, with the latter's strong multilateral institutions like the European Union and NATO. But this is beginning to change. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) joined with the three major Northeast Asian powers, China, Japan and South Korea, to form a group called Asean Plus Three in 1998. In addition, the Chiang Mai Initiative links the central banks of 13 East Asian countries and provides swap facilities in case of speculative attacks of the sort that occurred during the financial crisis of 1997-98. At the Asean summit meeting in Vientiane, Laos, last December, the organization decided to hold an East Asian Summit some time next year in Kuala Lumpur that would bring together the leaders of the Asean Plus Three group, but not those of the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, or India.There is a great deal of irony in this development. In 1990, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohammed proposed the creation of an East Asian Economic Caucus, a multilateral grouping of East Asian powers that would deliberately exclude countries like the U.S. and Australia -- a ""caucus without the Caucasians."" The U.S. and Australia were vehemently opposed to this. At American behest, the Japanese quietly sought to kill the idea, while the Australians worked hard to promote a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as an alternative. What Asean Plus Three and the proposed East Asian Summit represent is a resurrection of the old Mahathir proposal, but this time with mighty China rather than tiny Malaysia driving the process forward. Japan, which earlier had acted as America's cat's paw in stopping the Mahathir plan, is now on board.The roots of these developments lie in the Asian economic crisis, and in a series of highly effective Chinese diplomatic initiatives over the past several years. There has always been a huge gulf in perceptions about the causes and consequences of the Asian crisis between the U.S. and countries in East Asia. Americans tended to see the problem as one of crony capitalism, poor corporate governance, and flawed exchange rate management on the part of Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and other countries. The East Asians, by contrast, interpreted the behavior of the U.S. and U.S.-influenced international financial institutions like the IMF as narrowly self-interested, seeking to open up Asian financial markets to U.S. investment banks. To this day, South Koreans refer to the crisis of late 1997 as the ""IMF crisis.""In the aftermath of the crisis, Washington continued to bat down proposals from the region for new institutions to mitigate future financial shocks, like the Japanese proposal for an Asian IMF. Since the Clinton administration had little to offer the region in terms of new ideas or institutions, countries there took matters into their own hands and established the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asean Plus Three.

Other works in his oeuvre include a ""carpet"" of candies neatly packaged in cellophane, a photograph of an unmade bed and strings of faint light bulbs suspended from a ceiling or draped across a wall. The asking price for the cookie ""installation"": $600,000 to $800,000.Vaunting the art, a Christie's executive conjectured that fortune cookies, with their cheerful adages, inject a measure of optimism into an often dismal world. It's a fascinating if pompous notion, but hardly one that would have occurred to me during my Brooklyn childhood in the 1930s, when my parents, brother and I gathered on Sunday evenings with uncles, aunts and cousins for supper at the Pearl Dragon, as our favorite Chinese restaurant was grandly titled. Catering to its heavily Jewish clientele, the restaurant disguised wonton as kreplach on the menu and only closed twice a year -- on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah.The gargantuan dinners ran the spectrum from egg drop soup, moo goo gai pan, chicken chow mein and shrimp in lobster sauce, to barbecued spareribs, pepper beef, fried noodles and bowls of steamed rice. But they always culminated with the ubiquitous fortune cookie. Over cups of fragrant jasmine tea, we would crack them open and gleefully recite their saccharin maxims: ""Hard work reaps rewards,"" ""You will ride the train to success,"" ""Honesty is the best policy"" and, of course, ""Romance awaits you.""Subsequently, as I developed an interest in Chinese cuisine, I learned that fortune cookies are as American as apple pie a la mode. One version holds that they were invented in 1916 by a Los Angeles noodle manufacturer, David Jung, who purportedly drew his inspiration from a surreptitious practice reaching back to the 14th century, when the Mongols still ruled China.Dissidents struggling to oust the ""barbarians"" communicated with each other by concealing messages inside ""moon cakes,"" festival pastries typically filled with lotus seed paste. Thanks to their clever gimmick, they triumphed and founded the Ming dynasty.

WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats have big ambitions but little room to maneuver in this year's restrictive budget climate.Lawmakers are hoping to improve health insurance, create new child-care programs and even spend more money on the military, particularly for veterans. But they are hemmed in by the rising cost of the war, the ballooning budget deficit and a law passed last year that strictly limits new spending.""There's more and more evidence of social decay, and less and less money to cope with it,"" says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). ""It's tremendously frustrating.""This strain is largely the product of last year's budget agreement. The new budget law sets strict spending ceilings on all domestic, military and foreign aid appropriations.

837,"The White House Is Serious, but Not in the GOP's Way. Regarding Kimberley Strassel's ""This Unserious White House"" (Potomac Watch, Nov. 30): A White House that is deadly serious about transforming America and a president who openly admits a willingness to sacrifice growth for fairness need not be too serious about averting a fiscal cliff. If primary objectives are to expand the welfare state and redistribute as much income as possible in the process, the fiscal cliff and a possible recession are not so alarming, particularly since the media are teed up to blame obstinate Republicans for an impasse. The Journal's same-day news headline ""Obama's Cliff Offer Spurned"" generally leads a skim-reader to sympathize with the one being spurned, not the one doing the spurning.For historical perspective on the Obama era, the 1930s are most instructive. In the mid-1930s President Franklin Roosevelt's second term was dedicated to preserving New Deal entitlements and programs and building federal government power. Economic growth was an afterthought. Unemployment was about 15% when his second term began and about 15% when it ended (and higher in between). The stock market sank. Washington grew much faster than the private sector. FDR's legacy, had he not served a third term after 1940, would be: He saved capitalism from itself after Republicans and Wall Street mucked it up; he created massive new benefit plans and vastly increased the state's reach and resources; and he browbeat the rich into submission while redistributing income with a vengeance. He did not, however, engineer a sustained economic recovery. Instead, he transformed the nation in eight years and for that he most likely would be ranked as a top-10 president regardless of his poor economic results and without his World War II leadership.The economy has its ups and downs, and President Obama has been immunized from responsibility for the downs -- as was FDR. Widespread tax increases, drastic cuts in defense spending, no substantive reform of entitlements and little White House accountability for economic pain may be a perfectly acceptable, if not desirable, outcome. It actually may be harder for President Obama to leapfrog FDR on the transformation (and top-five presidential ranking) scale if the economy is humming along and people need less help from Washington. The fiscal cliff is as rare an opportunity as was the Great Depression to permanently alter the balance of power between public and private sectors.

It said the proposal calls for the delivery of a total of 122 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.If completed, the contract would be among the largest power-sales agreements negotiated by the provincially owned electric company, which has been aggressively marketing its electricity for export.Under the proposal, Hydro-Quebec would deliver 400,000 kilowatts of power to Central Maine beginning in 1992, and Central Maine would sell half of that to other utilities. Deliveries would increase to 600,000 kilowatts in 1995 and to 900,000 in 2000.Central Maine said the average price of the electricity will be about 9.5 cents a kilowatt-hour, subject to adjustments for inflation.

In the current tax cut debate, 10-year revenue costs of $350 billion and $550 billion are being debated, but the question should be: for what? President Bush's tax cut was designed to provide short-term growth insurance and enhance long-term growth. Does it deliver?If you listen to the political rhetoric, the most controversial of the president's tax proposals is the elimination of the double tax on corporate income. This would not be the case if scientific analysis were introduced into the debate. So far, neither the administration nor the Joint Committee on Taxation has provided an element-by-element evaluation of the different proposals. Name-calling tends to break out when there is no substance to discuss.When the Council of Economic Advisers considered the economic benefits of the president's entire proposal, the agency emphasized demand-side effects on consumer spending and investment in the near term. Using a conventional forecasting model, effects of the tax plan on job prospects, household disposable income, and incentives to invest were projected to raise real GDP by about $670 billion over the next five years. This increase in output would raise revenues by $133 billion over that period.But even that analysis omits the long-run supply-side benefits. The dividend tax reduction has the strongest economic merits. Ending the double tax raises long-term income by increasing capital formation and improving the use of existing capital.The first thing to track is the direct effect on investment. The dividend tax cut significantly reduces the cost of financing new investments. If businesses invest more, economic growth increases. The connection between the cost of finance and business investment is one of the least contentious areas of economic science, and cautious applications of the results from studies of tax policy and investment suggest that eliminating dividend taxation should add about a quarter of a percentage point to real GDP every year.",0,1.0,0.0,3908

If China does agree to unhitch the yuan from the dollar -- or at least give it some wiggle room -- it might not have much impact, leaving the U.S. with its huge trade deficit and Europe with a too-strong currency, uncompetitive industries and poor economic growth, just as it exists now.On the other hand, a move to really disconnect the yuan and other Asian currencies' ties to the dollar could send U.S. interest rates higher and the American economy lower.Last week, European Central Bank chief economist Otmar Issing opened the West's verbal assault on the East, arguing that the euro's rise and dollar's fall had gone far enough and that it was Asia's turn to carry the can. ""In terms of foreign-exchange developments, we see at the European level the adjustment is completed and has even gone too far,"" Mr. Issing said in a speech.

They are setting up new factories and sales chains. They are buying huge volumes of U.S. government securities that finance the federal budget deficit.Much of this investment is due to the withering of American industry and the low value of the dollar.

But it appears to have backed away from an earlier plan that would have required beneficiaries of Medicare, the federal health-care insurance program for people aged 65 and over and the disabled, to switch to private insurance if they wanted to receive a drug benefit.Mr. Bush is expected to unveil the White House framework soon, perhaps as early as next week when he is scheduled to address the American Medical Association. The plan, beyond establishing the principles for a drug benefit, calls for changes that would increase the role of private health plans in the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Mr. Bush anticipates the combined changes would cost about $400 billion during the next decade.The decision to focus on a broad framework, and not details, reflects a major shift in strategy by the White House. In early January, Bush aides had hoped to write a comprehensive plan and let the president drive the debate on an issue that has split Republicans and Democrats in the past two elections.",0,1.0,0.0,3547

866,"Wall Street Underwriting: Stock and Bond Financings Soared 63% to Record High. NEW YORK -- A big drop in interest rates triggered a wave of corporate bond refinancings that powered Wall Street investment banks to a record quarter of stock and bond sales.But disclosed fees, or the money that Wall Street investment banks earn from underwriting new stocks and bonds, fell far short of a record, largely because the bulk of the quarter's financings were bond issues that typically reap far slimmer fees than stock offerings.The volume of domestic stock and bond financings jumped 63% to $472.7 billion during the first quarter, up from $290.7 billion in the same period last year, smashing the previous record of $372.5 billion set in last year's third quarter, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J. concern that tracks corporate-finance activity.If Wall Street investment banks keep up the breakneck pace, total stock and bond volumes could approach the $2 trillion mark this year, far eclipsing the record of $1.3 trillion underwritten in 1997.

It was Mr. Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget chief, who proclaimed 27 years ago: ""I'm just not going to spend a lot of political capital solving some other guy's problem in 2010."" That other guy -- or gal -- will be the next president of the United States.To be sure, in many ways the federal budget is in better shape today than it was in Mr. Stockman's day. As a share of the economy, federal outlays and receipts were smaller last year than in fiscal year 1982. Because outlays fell more than receipts, the federal budget deficit amounted to only 1.2% of GDP last year, down from 4% in 1982. In fact, if the economy grows as projected and Congress maintains current tax laws and spending policies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a federal budget surplus by 2012.That's the good news. Nevertheless, our next president will encounter three ticking tax bombs in the weeks following the inauguration, as he or she prepares the budget for fiscal year 2010. Should even one of them detonate, we all will suffer the consequences.The first ticking bomb is the fate of the Bush tax cuts. CBO's optimistic federal budget surplus projection is based on the assumption that Congress will allow the president's tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. That would trigger the largest tax increase in history (nearly $1.9 trillion over seven years), raising taxes on 115 million taxpayers, and returning to the tax rolls 7.8 million low- and middle-income families who now pay no federal income tax because of the Bush tax cuts.If this bomb explodes, one thing is certain: It will damage the economy.

Ever since news emerged that ABN Amro Holding NV was not only in play but in exclusive takeover talks with Barclays PLC of the U.K., it has seemed to be only a matter of time before other big banks began circling. The real question was whom. Now comes news that a faction within U.S. giant Citigroup Inc. is pushing Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Prince to bid for the big Dutch bank.The fact that any move would have to be unsolicited, and might be considered hostile, complicates matters. Hostile takeover bids in the banking industry are difficult to win, and hostile deals of all stripes are particularly tough in the Netherlands, where companies enjoy many defenses that aren't allowed elsewhere, as Carrick Mollenkamp, Jason Singer and Dennis K. Berman report. Indeed, the Dutch central bank has already said it would frown on such a situation.However, ABN Amro and Citigroup have complementary businesses in the U.S. and Latin America, and a deal would give Citigroup a stronger foothold in continental Europe. There also is the possibility that Citigroup could push for part of ABN's assets, such as Chicago-based LaSalle Bank or Banco ABN Amro Real SA of Brazil, each of which contribute about 17% to ABN's overall revenue.Nonetheless, the Dutch community might not like a Citigroup bid, fearing it would reduce the bank's Dutch headcount aggressively, according to corporate government consultant Jaap Koelewijn. But he also considers the proposed Barclays takeover no more than a diversion, arguing that active investors won't accept it because other competitors could achieve greater synergies and hence be able to pay a higher premium.Read Carrick Mollenkamp, Jason Singer and Dennis K.

As an economist from Japan working in Washington, D.C., I think the readers need some perspective from the other side of the Pacific.Contrary to the Sept. 2 editorial ""The Japan as No. 1 Myth,"" most workers in Japanese industries feel that Japan's export-oriented policy in the past has helped in raising their standard of living by securing enough job opportunities. Visit any plant of Toyota Motor Corp., and you will find in the parking lots better-equipped Toyota cars than those sold in the U.S., owned by even the youngest workers. And drive around Toyota City; the roads around are quite good, thanks in part to the contribution of local taxes that Toyota paid to surrounding municipalities.It is correct, however, to mention that high prices of land and food products are causing a lot of problems in Japan. Many regulations, tariffs, and subsidies hurt cheaper food imports. But the question is, why is there not sufficient political leverage, or consumer willingness, to change the legal and policy environment related to this problem? One of the reasons is that the consumer movement is not well organized enough in Japan to give it a sufficient say in the political arena. On the other hand, farmers and small-scale distributors with vested interests are much more well organized and have substantial influence in the policy setting of the government.In addition, most consumers living in cities have close relatives in farming regions. In 1950s and '60s, many people migrated from farming area to cities searching for jobs. So subsidies to the farming sector are a disguised form of social-security payments to the older population living in the farm regions that draw implicit approval from city dwellers.The problem with distribution is related to the unemployment problem. Japan's distribution sector, in addition to the agricultural sector, is a reservoir of disguised unemployed people. There are people who cannot fit well in other, more efficient sectors, who have no other choice but hanging around mom-and-pop grocery stores. It is technically possible to create a straightlined, efficient distribution channel using nationwide chains of supermarkets such as those in the U.S. in just a short period of time, and consumers in Japan would definitely like it. But everyone in Japan knows that unemployment caused by creation of such a distribution sector would be substantial. And the rest of the Japanese population would have no other choice but to support those pushed out of the distribution channel. Paying higher prices for food and other basic commodities reluctantly, consumers in Japan are in fact supporting these disguised unemployed in the backward sector of the economy.",0,1.0,0.0,5087
872,"Pay Envelopes Hold the Answer to What Drives Prices Up. Anytime the consumer price index goes up, as the government reported it did last month, some financial analysts immediately worry that the Federal Reserve will respond by boosting short-term interest rates.In fact, many Fed officials, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually pay more attention to what is happening to costs that could push inflation up in the future - than to recent changes in prices.The numbers Fed officials monitor most closely are those on labor costs, because for most businesses they are the biggest cost item by far. For the average business, wages paid to employees and the cost of fringe benefits represent more than 70 percent of all expenses. The labor statistic that economists follow most closely is ""unit labor costs,"" which tracks the labor cost of each unit produced, and thus reflects any labor-saving productivity gains.The chart at right shows how closely consumer price inflation has tracked changes in unit labor costs since 1980. It also indicates why so many analysts think inflation will remain subdued for some time to come: Unit labor costs are low and give no sign of accelerating.In the 12 months that ended in September, businesses other than farms increased worker compensation an average of 3.2 percent, according to the Labor Department. But productivity gains - increases in the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked - of 1.4 percent meant that firms' unit labor costs rose only 1.8 percent.",0,0.6946,0.3054,1627

Wait, I thought you told the SEC.Charter Communications Inc., the cable operator controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, is hitting bumps with an unusual issue of new stock tied to its sale last November of $862.5 million in convertible notes. Charter isn't shouldering its burden alone. The investors who bought those notes are right there with it.Selling the convertibles was a tall order to start with. The St. Louis company has more than $19 billion in debt, and bearish short sellers account for more than a third of Charter's publicly available stock. Ordinarily, hedge funds -- major buyers of convertibles -- would take a pass. These investors typically borrow a company's stock and short it as a hedge against owning the convertibles -- if the stock rises the convertibles become more valuable; should the stock fall, the short position pays off. But the huge short position in Charter stock makes it prohibitively expensive to borrow more of the stock to sell it short.So Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., the underwriter of the convertibles, came up with a twist. The bank lined up investors for the notes and got Charter to promise to issue 150 million shares of new stock that would be lent to Citigroup. Citigroup would turn around and lend the stock to the note buyers, enabling them to replace the expensive stock they borrowed to short Charter and thus comfortably lock in their hedge against the 5.875% notes, which mature in November 2009 and can be converted into Charter shares should the stock hit $2.42.

But for now, some agencies that had expected modest U.S. spending gains say they will be lucky to have a flat year.Such pessimism is jarring in this professionally optimistic business -- all the more so because agencies virtually never abandon their spending forecasts so early in the year.D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, for one, had expected a 4% to 5% increase in 1991 U.S. spending. But since the Persian Gulf war broke out, it has shaved that to ""flat to slightly declining,"" says Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive officer. ""It started with the softening economy,"" he says. ""Then confidence took a terrible jolt with the war.""Similarly, Saatchi & Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit last fall was shooting for a 10% revenue increase. But even before the war broke out, it downgraded its expectations to a flat year, says Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer. Omnicom Group's BBDO had ""expected a modest increase"" in U.S. spending when it planned its 1991 budget in December, says Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive. ""But our thinking is changing very rapidly. We're beginning to experience the cuts already. Whether or not those cuts will be reinstated later in the year is a crapshoot.""",0,0.6721,0.3279,4874
884,"No Peace Dividend?. If there is to be no peace dividend, as Defense Secretary Richard Cheney keeps telling us, why not? If the Pentagon budgets are being cut, as Cheney also keeps telling us, where is the money going? Somebody must be pulling our leg.The first lesson to be drawn from the apparent contradiction between Cheney's promise of a big reduction in defense spending and the prospect of no peace dividend, is this: Cheney isn't really offering a major cut in defense spending. On the contrary, he is proposing only to keep defense spending from rising as rapidly in the next five years as it otherwise would have. Moreover, the average Pentagon spending level in the five-year period, 1996-2000, would jump to $365 billion annually from an average of $304 billion in 1991-95. Hence, no apparent defense cut, no apparent peace dividend.But if defense spending were to be reduced enough to reflect political reality-namely, that the West is in less danger of attack from the Soviet Union than it was before-there must be a peace dividend.It would be one thing if Cheney were to say that some part of the peace dividend has already been spoken for: the savings-and-loan debacle alone will chew up $200 billion in the decade of the '90s that could have been better spent elsewhere. And the probability is that taxpayers will have to fork over billions to make good on some other government-insured or -sponsored programs. But those unfortunate costs would be there even if there had been no dramatic prodemocracy developments within Eastern Europe and a better understanding with the Soviet Union.The problem is how to assess all of the bills facing the nation in changed circumstances, and to determine how to allocate our total resources. And the first task is to cut through all of the gobbledygook of Cheney's numbers. He projected a ""$180 billion reduction"" in defense spending over five years. That, first of all, refers to budget authority, not outlays, which would be down $120 billion. But that is a bit of fantasy-a cut from earlier, projected levels of expenditures that have not yet been reached, not from current levels.",0,0.667,0.33299999999999996,74

888,"The Original Culture Warriors; For lower-middle-class women serving coffee to bosses, full-time motherhood wasn't the concentration camp described by feminists.. Even as we tremble at the edge of a fiscal cliff, the culture war insists on our attention. Abortion, contraception, gay and women's rights, and welfare have all returned to shake up an election season that was supposed to be a simple economy slugfest. Robert O. Self's ""All in the Family"" could help explain why. Mr. Self, a professor of history at Brown University, has heroically researched the history of the culture wars from the early 1960s to the present. He offers a provocative analysis that accounts for today's alliance between small-government and social conservatives, on the one hand, and welfare-state and social liberals, on the other.Mr. Self begins his history by describing ""breadwinner liberalism"" as the status quo of the early and mid-1960s. The architects of the Great Society assumed the primacy of male-earner and female-homemaker families. Labor unions fought for a family wage for their predominantly male membership, the Moynihan Report (1965) raised alarms about black male unemployment, and the first efforts at affirmative action took the form of quotas in municipal contracts for male construction workers. In all these cases ""women were largely an afterthought,"" Mr. Self writes. Breadwinner liberalism, he argues, was based on a model of ""masculine individualism"": hardworking, striving, self-reliant.By the late 1960s, male breadwinners were beset from all sides. Their antiwar sons grew their hair long and scoffed at verities about masculine honor. Gays, going public early in the decade as self-defined ""homophiles,"" challenged presumptions about masculine sexuality. Traditional men watched anxiously as their wives brought home paychecks and as women generally demanded relief from sexual harassment, low pay and pink-collar ghettos. Men soon saw their daughters demonstrating for abortion rights. Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and various court decisions, it seemed as if the government, the courts and their own families all agreed: The traditional male-headed family was an anachronism.But, the author concludes, breadwinning men weren't disappearing; they and their female supporters were just changing political parties. For many lower-middle-class women serving coffee to bosses and stocking grocery shelves, full-time motherhood wasn't the concentration camp described by feminists. They found a voice in antifeminists like Phyllis Schlafly, who almost single-handedly stopped the Equal Rights Amendment in the late 1970s. Catholic women and men organized groups to oppose abortion and were soon joined by evangelicals. Other grass-root groups emerged, some in support of Vietnam veterans and others celebrating what came to be known as family values. What was taking shape was the profound class and cultural divide that vexes our politics to this day.In a vivid chapter, Mr. Self describes the 1972 Democratic National Convention, a pivotal moment in the reshaping of political alignments. AFL-CIO President George Meany railed that, in the party platform, ""there were no steelworkers, no pipe fitters, and worst of all, no plumbers."" Instead there were feminists, radical blacks, Chicanos and gays--co-conspirators in a left-wing attack on breadwinner liberalism. In reaction, a constellation of religious, white, ""ethnic"" and anti-feminist objectors joined forces to create ""breadwinner conservatism."" By 1980, with the help of a vigorous evangelical revival, these one-time Democrats helped elect Ronald Reagan president.",0,1.0,0.0,855

890,"Short-Term Rates Continue Sharp Drop As Federal Funds Charges Lead Decline. NEW YORK -- Short-term interest rates fell sharply again yesterday, continuing a steep decline that began early this month.Rates on some Treasury bills tumbled by about three-eighths of a percentage point. The interest rate on federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other, dropped to as low as 4% yesterday afternoon from Tuesday's average of 9.24%.The big drop in rates this month mainly reflects a slowdown in economic growth and a credit-easing move by the Federal Reserve System, many analysts say. But even these analysts contend that yesterday's extremely low federal funds rate probably was an aberration. Banks and savings institutions had to settle their accounts yesterday with the Fed. The funds rate often swings widely on settlement days.Interest rates have tumbled in recent weeks despite a huge volume of U.S. notes and bonds that have been sold. Yesterday, the Treasury sold $6.02 billion of new three-year, 11-month notes at an average annual yield of 11.42%. That was down sharply from 13.69% at the previous auction of similar notes last June and was the lowest auction average since last December.

And small businesses almost unanimously welcome the initiative as an overdue stimulus to the economy.But many business owners worry that the president might come up with the wrong combination of measures. Some fear that too many tax breaks could backfire by widening the budget deficit, triggering either new tax increases or deep cuts in government spending. Others fret that the administration might offer too little, too late.

The Federal Reserve Board's rate cut yesterday increased the chances that months of Fed moves could start to trickle down to homeowners in time to ease the pain when adjustable-rate mortgages reset this year. And people who borrow money to pay tuition, buy cars or cover unpaid credit card bills might eventually see some benefit.But the Fed's action could also revive inflation, many economists fear. By reducing the interest rate financial institutions charge each other for short-term loans, the Fed makes money more readily and cheaply available. If it miscalculates, it can pump too much money into the economy, fueling excessive demand for goods, housing and capital spending -- and driving up prices.That would undermine Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's long-cherished notion of setting a low, narrow and predictable target range for inflation. Through higher consumer prices, all Americans would effectively help pay for the rescue of the financial industry. The decline in housing prices might be tempered, but inflation would eat away at real housing values.""The good news is that this will take pressure off of housing prices,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University.

Many analysts and policymakers worry that continuing corporate layoffs and hiring freezes will cause consumers to pull back sharply on their spending, tipping the economy into recession.""The fallout from a deteriorating job market on consumer spending hasn't kicked in yet, and when it does, it won't be pretty,"" said Allen Sinai, a leading economic forecaster.However, investors saw in the news an encouraging sign that businesses were moving aggressively to cut costs, trim excess capacity and return quickly to profitability.

911,"New Job Data Cast Doubt on Economy's Slowing. WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week.",1,0.0,1.0,36

In reviewing the U.S. Treasury bond market in 1991, one cannot help but be impressed by the steep decline in interest rates and by the volume of actual financing.We are all aware of the weakness that permeated the economy and how the Federal Reserve responded to that weakness during the year. Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term UIadministeredU ratesUOthe discount rate and the federal funds rateUOwhich the Fed directly controls.As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.Another feature of last yearUas market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates.

Some optimistic experts are now saying that though this will be a turbulent year for global markets, the worst of the financial crisis is now behind us. Would it were so. We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global ""stag-deflation"": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years. During the 1980s, the U.S. also faced the burdens of twin deficits, but relied on financing from key strategic partners like Japan and Germany. This time, the situation is more worrisome because today's financing comes not from U.S. allies, but from strategic rivals like Russia, China and a number of relatively unstable petrostates.

With the economy strong and the balanced-budget fight behind them, Democrats and Republicans find themselves groping for economic issues to argue about when they return to Washington this week.Part of the problem, strategists from both parties acknowledge, is that economic issues simply don't stir voter passions when times are so good: when inflation is subdued, the jobless rate has fallen to a three-decade low and the stock market remains buoyant. Indeed, many economic policy entrepreneurs say they are writing off the next two years and instead are concentrating on ideas that will resonate in the 2000 presidential campaign.Equally vexing, however, is that policy proposals being debated in both political camps seem as likely to highlight intra-party differences as to draw clear distinctions between Republicans and Democrats.White House economic advisers, reflecting President Clinton's interest in securing his legacy, are pondering long-term challenges -- how to boost productivity through improvements in education, for example, or how to ensure lasting solvency for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. ""It's one of those rare moments when you have a chance to step back and reflect on your fundamental priorities,"" said Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council.But some congressional Democrats have more immediate concerns.

948,"Reigning Wisdom's Shaky Economic Ground. Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the ""overvalued"" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)",1,0.0,1.0,250

Because banks play a central role in financing economic growth, the credit crunch has broad effects on the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says it has ""very little historic precedent.""What caused it?With more and more loans going sour, the economy weakening and real estate values falling, bankers have grown more cautious. The memories of the excesses and financial failures of the 1980s are crimping lending in the 1990s. In addition, new rules, or capital standards, require many banks to either raise more capital from investors or make fewer loans. Unable or unwilling to raise capital, many banks are pulling back on lending.",1,0.0,1.0,281

Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or ""outlays,"" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Their estimates show spending is down nearly 12% on average since May from a year earlier.",1,0.0,1.0,293

Johnson in his long congressional career and in his five years as president made a high art of public benefaction.From the gift of government-subsidized electricity to his Hill Country neighbors at the start of his career, to Medicare and Model Cities in the high-flying Great Society days at the end, he practiced generosity of unparalleled scale with the taxpayers' money. His stump speeches in the 1964 campaign promised that Washington would provide help for ""Molly and the babies,"" down to and specifically including ""a house for the family and pictures on the walls.""Appreciative as they were of those benefits, the voters have decided in every presidential election but one since 1968 that enough is enough. Though they regularly tell pollsters they think the Democrats are more sympathetic to working people and their problems and have given those Democrats a near-permanent lease on Congress, they have thought it prudent to keep a check on extravagance by having the GOP control the White House.This is a gut-level, instinctive, extraconstitutional addition to the many other ""checks and balances"" in our system of government.

985,"A Card to Borrow Your Future; Can Access to Credit Encourage Savings?. For a quarter-century, a Boston inventor has been obsessed with a single idea: an innovation that would give millions of American workers the chance to borrow their own money from their 401(k) savings plans using a new kind of credit card.In 1980 the inventor, an animated fellow named Francis Vitagliano, shared his concept with an MIT professor, Franco Modigliani. The Italian-born economist had been writing for 20 years about his theory of how and when people spend and save money during their lifetime, the so-called Life-Cycle Hypothesis. Modigliani's work would win him the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics, but the call from Vitagliano would, he thought, give him a way to test his theory in real life.The men became champions for this new financial instrument, spending untold sums for a patent on the card idea, trying to sell it to banks and credit card companies, and withstanding a barrage of criticism from members of Congress and the financial community.Franco Modigliani died last year at age 85. But tomorrow in Washington, Francis Vitagliano, now 55, is scheduled to watch as the 401(k) card is unveiled at a financial conference. Appearing on a panel will be an official of ING, the global financial services company that has licensed Patent No. 5206803 and is preparing to introduce the new card to employers and their k-plan participants soon, after receiving final regulatory approval from the state of Connecticut.In this time of worry about the American retirement system, the card will once again cause a flap -- but possibly not as much as it has in the past. Whatever the immediate outcome, this is not the last stop for the controversial card as it does or does not become a staple of American getting and spending.

It is an effort that could also save money, though that isnUat its major purpose.Because welfare developments donUat get much public attention, many people may have missed or forgotten the striking series of changes in federal policy designed to reduce welfare rolls by encouraging work.The seminal legislation was the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. This legislation provided states with several billion dollars over five years to pay for education, training, child care and other services intended to help mothers leave welfare for workUOincluding one year of health benefits and day care after leaving welfare.Congress and Presidents Reagan and Bush have collaborated on several other pieces of legislation designed to help promote work. The 1986 tax reform bill eliminated or dramatically reduced federal taxes for low-income workers. The bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an earnings subsidy paid by the federal government to low-income working families with children. In 1990 Congress and President Bush expanded the EITC even more.

But this makes the paltry 1.5% growth more disconcerting, because it means that other parts of the economy are growing less rapidly than they ought to be.Consumption ticked up only 1.5%, for example, down from 2.4% in the first quarter.

But there has been a continued demand for funds in the capital markets. Consequently, interest rates have been only slightly below the recent highs UO which have been around the highest rates in over 20 years.The latest rate for new 91-day Treasury Bills was about 3.47 per cent, only slightly below the then prevailing discount rate of 3.5 per cent and well above the new discount rate of 3 per cent. Jn theory, the new condition would seem to encourage member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks at 3 per cent and use the funds to buy bills at 3.45 per cent, which would, of course, tend to expand bank credit.A reduction of the discount rate below the bill rate is a most unusual development, in fact, I cannot find a duplication of it in the record of the past 25 years.THE MOVE is all the more startling because public remarks made by FRB Chairman Martin only about two w'eeks ago were bluntly in defense of the tight credit policy, and his observations then would seem to justify the publicUas interpretation that the tight credit policy was likely to continue.",1,0.3468,0.6532,514

On one hand, higher taxes could slow down the economy by taking money out of the pockets of consumers. On the other hand, the prospect of smaller federal budget deficits has already driven down interest rates and made it cheaper for ordinary people and corporations to borrow and spend.""The Clinton plan for the economy raises many questions,U said Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economics professor and chairman of former president Ronald ReaganUas Council of Economic Advisers.

The deficit reflected a decline in exports of $1.5 billion, while imports remained largely flat. The drop covered a broad range of exports, but a number of analysts dismissed it as a statistical aberration.""Over the last year, exports were up 10%; over the last three months, exports rose almost 20% at an annual rate,"" says John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns. ""The trend is unambiguously higher."" The National Association of Manufacturers also dismissed the decline as ""a one-time correction.""The widening trade deficit could put downward pressure on the dollar as investors lose confidence in the ability of the U.S. to repay its debts, boosting the prices of imports higher than they otherwise would be. But the deficit can also be a signal of economic strength. That is because the U.S. is growing more rapidly than other industrialized nations and absorbing more imports than its trading partners.Retail sales, which grew at a 1.2% pace in May, compared with a 0.6% drop in April, was another signal of a strengthening U.S. economy.

Last year, U.S. exports, industrial production, real hourly compensation, corporate profits, federal tax revenues, retail sales, GDP, productivity, the number of people with jobs, the number of students in college, airline passenger traffic and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all hit record levels. For the third consecutive year, global growth was strong, continuing to lift (and hold) millions of people out of poverty. From 30,000 feet, heck from 1,000 feet, it sure looks like the best of times.In relative terms, the first five years of the current recovery have been much better than the first five years of the 1990s recovery. But all this has not softened the pessimism of many pundits and politicians who are either unimpressed or expect the whole thing to come crashing down any minute. That is, unless the government firmly grabs the reins of the global economy and steers it clear of disaster.Many believe that the debate is over on global warming, nationalized health care, tax hikes, rich-versus-poor, the trade deficit and ""obscene"" oil company profits. Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again. Between 1965 and 1981, Great Society welfare and health-care programs, wage and price controls, inflationary Fed policy, 70% marginal tax rates, 50% capital-gains tax rates, and highly regulated energy, airline, banking and trucking industries created severe problems.

If the other nations do not agree, such a reduction probably still would come within two to three months, he said.As recently as two weeks ago, many financial-market participants seemed to share GramleyUas view that the Fed would continue to reduce the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges on loans to financial institutions. Since then, scattered signs of faster economic growth and new fears about inflation have turned market sentiment around; long-term interest rates, in particular, have been rising.Prior to a rally yesterday, some long-term government bonds had dropped more than six points, with each point representing $10 in market value.

NEW YORK -- The prospect that the Federal Reserve could avert a recession through its aggressive easing of monetary policy is tolling a bearish knell for Treasurys.Last week, the Fed unexpectedly cut interest rates by a half percentage point, its fourth rate reduction of that size this year. That pushed the Federal funds rate, or overnight bank lending level, down to 4.5%.Bond investors always fear that returns on fixed-income securities such as Treasurys could be eroded in the long term if stronger growth is accompanied by higher inflation. Thus, in their view, what's good for the economy isn't necessarily healthy for the Treasurys market.Reflecting such fears, the 30-year Treasury bond Friday ended at about its highest yield of the year so far, or 5.793%. Its price, which moves inversely to its yield, was down 3/32 point from late Thursday at 94 1/32.Meantime, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 2/32 point, or 62 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 26/32.

1044,"Fairness and the Capital Tax Fetish. Friday's weak employment report reminds us anew of the flagging U.S. economic recovery. While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends.

The failure of the White House to promote an aggressive economic recovery plan may severely imperil GOP chances of holding on to the House and taking back control of the Senate in 2002. As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging.",1,0.0,1.0,792

It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns.",1,0.30700000000000005,0.693,871

LazearAs Washington debates the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many lawmakers have fallen into a logical trap of their own making. Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years.

The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys.

""We've certainly seen the lows in yield"" of this cycle, Mr. Greenlaw said, adding that the selloff in July has ""recorrected"" the Treasurys market back to where it was before deflation talk took hold.",1,0.3256,0.6744,928

It was the first increase since 1987 when the deficit hit a record $152.1 billion.The Labor Department also reported that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest monthly rise in two years.

The loss partly reflects two billion guilders in charges and provisions taken to cover such problems.Reflecting the difficult market conditions, sales fell 6% to 19 billion guilders from 20.3 billion guilders.

Those agreements with two small nations are just the overture for a much larger debate involving tariff-cutting deals with Colombia and South Korea. And then comes the monumental question of whether to give President Bush the same free hand that his predecessors have enjoyed in negotiating global and regional trade agreements, not amendable by Congress but subject only to an up-or-down vote.Before last week, there was no chance that a Democratic Congress would trust Bush to look out for the interests of American firms and workers in any such negotiations. Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.Such provisions -- requiring signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards banning child labor and prison labor and permitting union organizing, as well as requiring enforcement of their own environmental laws -- had been included in the final trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress.",1,0.3337,0.6663,984

The technology industry, an engine of innovation and U.S. prosperity for more than half a century, is accelerating its recovery from the recession with surging earnings that have spurred companies to sharply ramp up their hiring.The latest evidence for the rebound came Thursday, when Internet giant Google Inc. posted a 37% profit jump for the first quarter and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a 34% revenue increase to record levels. The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results.

Even with relative prosperity, the result is going to be rising unemployment.

A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing.""A striking feature"" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, ""has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business.""Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve ""pricing power"" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare ""service"" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs ""the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy.""Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course? What happens if industries shutter excess factories around the world or if inventories are trimmed? What happens to prices if industries become more concentrated oligopolies?",1,0.0,1.0,1122

Author: Alan GreenspanAn urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008.

NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%.

From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy.

Economists and government officials are increasingly worried that in its efforts to restrain the U.S. economy's current boom, the Federal Reserve may boost interest rates so much that it produces a mild bust next year or in 1996.The Fed, which has already raised interest rates six times this year in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the red-hot economy, could act again at a policy-making session today. But analysts said the central bank is more likely to wait until it meets next on Jan. 31.Many analysts now predict that to curb the economy's robust growth, the Fed will have to provide such a harsh dose of interest rate medicine - raising short-term interest rates at least a percentage point on top of this year's increases of 2.5 percentage points - that it will eventually plunge the economy into recession.""There is less and less chance of a soft landing and a higher and higher chance of the more traditional boom-and-bust cycle,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.In its latest forecast, Merrill Lynch & Co. said last week that strong economic growth in early 1995 could lead the Fed to raise rates ""by more than we currently expect.

Could record levels of government spending, waves of new regulation and political credit allocation, and unprecedented monetary stimulus re-ignite growth? The results have been rolling in, and they represent what increasingly looks like an historic mistake that deserves to be called the Keynesian growth discount.***The latest evidence is yesterday's disappointing report of 1.8% in first quarter GDP. At this stage of recovery after a deep recession, the economy is typically growing by 4% or more as consumer confidence returns and businesses accelerate investment as their profits revive. Yet in this recovery consumers are still cautious and business investment remains weak.Some of the first quarter's growth slump is due to seasonal factors such as bad weather and weaker defense spending. In the silver lining department, the private economy grew faster than the overall GDP figure because government spending declined. But even maintaining the 2.9% growth rate of 2010 would mark an historic underachievement for a recovery after a recession that was as deep as the one from late 2007 to mid-2009.The most recent recession of comparable depth and job loss was in 1981-1982, when unemployment hit 10.8%. Huge chunks of industrial America shut down and never re-opened. Yet once the recovery began in earnest in the first quarter of 1983, the economy boomed. As the nearby table shows, growth exceeded 7.1% for five consecutive quarters, and it kept growing at nearly a 4% pace for another two years.

Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand?

Workers across the country are seeing the length of their jobless benefits pared back, a shakeout that is playing out unevenly and pinching people in states still struggling with unemployment above the national average.The changes in benefits are partly the result of an improving job market but are also due to budget pressures at the state and federal level.In Michigan, one of the states hardest-hit by the economic downturn and where unemployment remains close to 9%, job seekers will soon receive less than a year of benefits for the first time since the recession hit in 2007.Michigan, which like many states offered 99 weeks of state and federally funded benefits at the peak of its jobs crisis, will become the 19th state to offer less than a year of payments to new claimants for jobless benefits. Nine other states offer more than a year but less than 60 weeks. More changes are coming: North Carolina recently passed a law that will cut benefits to 20 weeks starting in July.John Rowloff, a single father of two teenagers in Monroe, Mich., got the last of his unemployment checks earlier this year but says he has seen little improvement in the local labor market even as the state's official jobless rate has fallen to 8.9% from as high as 14.2% in 2009.",1,0.3426,0.6574,1377

1149,"The Evening Wrap: Paycheck Pressures. Higher energy prices, a lousy housing market and tighter credit continue to put the squeeze on consumers -- and Wal-Mart and Home Depot are feeling their pain.Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. ""It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,"" he said. ""The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been."" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an ""ebb tide in low-end consumer spending."" Goldman Sachs faulted ""the tougher macro environment"" for making the company's turnaround ""even tougher to enact,"" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's ""efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season."" And HSBC's note, echoing Mr. Scott, affirmed that the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle means that, for consumers, ""inflation takes a bite out of real spending growth.""In that regard, there was a glimmer of good news in economic data released Tuesday. Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports. Bear Stearns analysts wrote that the trade numbers will likely lead the Commerce Department to revise second-quarter economic growth around 4.3% from an originally reported 3.4%.---",1,0.34340000000000004,0.6566,1385

WASHINGTON -- Retail sales tumbled in March as job losses and tight credit left consumers cautious and constrained, damping hopes for a rapid economic turnaround.After some improvement earlier this year from a dismal autumn, retail sales in March fell 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Credit turmoil continued to hit automobile sales especially hard, but the declines also came in most major categories, from appliances to furniture to clothing stores. Retail sales, a broad tally that also includes food services, were down more than 9% from the same month a year ago.The decline signaled that consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, probably won't bounce back quickly from the depths of the recession. Consumers, hit by a weak job market and steep declines in household wealth, remain worried that more tough times lie ahead.The retail-sales report comes after weeks of hope that the recession was nearing its low point. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a speech Tuesday at Morehouse College in Atlanta, cited recent data on home sales, home building and consumer spending, including sales of new vehicles, as ""tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing.""

1157,"The 'Conundrum' Explained. In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.---Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time.",1,0.3874,0.6126,1423

Americans are earning more money -- but socking it away and not spending, undermining hopes for a consumer-driven rebound.The personal saving rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, jumped to 4.4% in June from 4% a month earlier and a recent low of 3.2% in November, the government said Tuesday, as consumers squirreled away cash amid the weak economy.Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June. Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.""This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy,"" said Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others.

A number of prominent Wall Street economists are cutting their estimates for U.S. economic growth in 1998, in part because of the turmoil in Southeast Asia but also due to some domestic concerns.The new estimates -- most still predicting moderate growth, yet trimming the growth rate by 0.5 percentage point or even more -- are based on a growing belief that U.S. exports to Asia will decline as economic growth there slows. In addition, there's a concern that U.S. consumer spending is weakening even as corporations and retailers continue to expand. Most of the revisions have come in the past week, following a sharp decline in many world markets, and despite a sharp rebound on Wall Street and elsewhere.The downward revisions to gross domestic product-the government's primary barometer of economic growthcame from economists at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., Aubrey G.

Widespread hopes for a year-end dollar rally were doused by last week's news of the record monthly U.S. trade deficit. But even before the trade report, Lawrence J. Greenberg, an economist at Chemical Bank, New York, had figured that a late-December sell-off was all but inevitable.In fact, Mr. Greenberg has predicted a late-December dollar decline for every year since 1981. In all but one period, his predictions proved right.The 40-year-old former Federal Reserve economist doesn't use a crystal ball. His annual year-end forecast is based on the dollar's historic trading pattern in Decembers. In 13 of the past 14 years, the dollar has fallen in value between mid-December and New Year's Day, and has failed to do so only twice since the start of the modern floating exchange system in the early 1970s.A nine-year veteran in Chemical's foreign exchange advisory service, Mr. Greenberg normally relies exclusively on fundamental economic factors in forecasting currency trends. But six years ago, with a shortage of any major factors in the typically dull holiday season, he recalled a series of end-of-the-year declines and saw a connection.""I'm struck by the consistency of it,"" he says of the trend. ""You're not going to get that by flipping a coin.""

1176,"Bad-News Poverty Figures. THE POLITICIANS pay too little attention; the 1988 income and poverty figures just issued by the Census Bureau are bad news.The longest sustained economic expansion in peacetime history has failed to drive the poverty rate back to the lows of the 1970s; the economy famous for lifting all boats no longer does so. Real per capita income was up, but this broadest measure of economic well-being is an average. As in other recent years, for the richest two-fifths of families median income and income share rose; for the poorest two-fifths they declined. The gap between rich and poor was the highest in the 40-odd years it has been measured.The poverty rate was 13.1 percent, more than one American in eight, down only 0.3 percent from the year before. The bureau called that steady. For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes.

The economy has been roaring along at a pace that makes analysts worry about a future upsurge of inflation. Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength.

The U.S. trade deficit rose to an all-time high of $61 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, dealing a fresh blow to hopes that the gap will start to shrink soon in response to the decline in the dollar.Exports stayed relatively flat, totaling $100.5 billion in February, just 0.1 percent, or $100 million, above the previous month's level. At the same time, the nation's pattern of importing more and more goods continued unchecked, as foreign products purchased by Americans rose 1.6 percent, or $2.6 billion, to $161.5 billion, led by oil, autos and consumer goods.The politically sensitive U.S. deficit with China narrowed in February to $13.9 billion from January's $15.3 billion level. But critics of China pointed out that the combined figure for those two months was 47 percent above the same period last year and said the report will fuel growing sentiment in Congress for a tougher policy on Beijing's trade practices.The overall gap was a record -- by itself nothing new, because the monthly trade deficit has smashed through previous highs eight times since the start of last year. But yesterday's report deepened concern that the flow of goods across U.S. borders does not seem to be responding to the dollar's fall, even though that decline has continued for three years.A cheaper dollar is supposed to spur sales of U.S. exports by making American goods more attractive to foreign purchasers, and reduce Americans' appetite for foreign products by making them more expensive. Together with some private economists, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted late last year that the move in the currency would start to exert an effect on trade flows and shrink the gap in months to come. So far, however, signs of such a development have been scant.",1,0.3385,0.6615,1602

The nation's unemployment rate fell slightly last month, and job growth picked up a bit, the Labor Department reported Friday, indicating that the weak labor market is continuing its slow recovery.The unemployment rate slipped in January to 5.6 percent, the lowest level in more than two years, and non-farm businesses added 112,000 jobs, on a seasonally adjusted basis, boosting their payrolls for the fifth consecutive month.While the movement was in the right direction, the degree of improvement was disappointing to economists and others who keep waiting for what otherwise appears to be a strong economic expansion to fuel a takeoff in hiring. And the signals of progress appeared alongside signs of continuing stress, as the average length of unemployment grew and manufacturing businesses shed 11,000 jobs, for a 42nd consecutive month of declines.The report ""displayed only minimal improvement,"" said Peter E.

1194,"Dollar Demand Is Strong, but Lending Lags Behind. The dollar remains in heavy demand from banks around the world, a sign trust among banks remains fragile.While a number of indicators show credit markets are thawing, economists, central bankers and investors are paying keen attention to the rate at which foreign banks are pulling dollar deposits out of their U.S. branches. That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans. A large gap has appeared between the one-month and three-month Libor, in what analysts say is a worrying sign that banks remain reluctant to make longer-term loans to one another. As of Friday, three-month dollar Libor was 1.01%, 0.59 percentage point more than the rate on one-month loans. Historically the gap hovered close to zero.",1,0.32730000000000004,0.6727,1630

The state is spending $50,000 to advertise in national newspapers to attract people back to the place from which thousands fled in the early 1980s when unemployment skyrocketed past 15%. One private company alone says it has about 1,000 openings.On behalf of hundreds of companies looking for skilled workers ranging from engineers and computer analysts to construction workers, the five-week campaign is essentially a huge help-wanted ad for the state. The ad, touted by Gov. John Engler's administration as proof of Michigan's economic comeback, comes complete with a list of fringe benefits, including affordable housing, 11,000 inland lakes and the nation's highest number of golf courses. Likely to be added soon: ""Home of the Stanley Cup Champions,"" after Detroit's beloved Red Wings won the title Saturday night.

And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly. So far, that hasn't been happening. Average hourly earnings were up just 2.1% in May versus a year earlier, and the Labor Department on Tuesday reported that, when adjusted for inflation, they were actually a shade lower.But companies think they will soon be paying more.

But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates.

If it's the war that is the focus of all this talk about change, well, that's understandable, and maybe people really do want change.

We're living in Internet Time, where policies and their consequences travel the world at the speed of light. The normal human reaction to such a rapid pace of change is to be overwhelmed, stressed out, anxious and fearful. As a result, it is probably true that when voters listen to talk about change, what they really hear are promises of ""no change,"" which would be a huge difference from the status quo. They just want things ""the way they were.""Look at the chart nearby (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ June 11, 2008).

A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; a reading below 50% signals contraction.While the growth is positive news for the manufacturing sector, which seemed to be leading an economic recovery last summer before petering to stagnation, it is much slower than the growth posted in February and March.

Fairfax County, still reeling from the recession and the collapsed real estate market, is facing a potential $97 million budget shortfall next year, according to county officials, virtually ensuring further cuts in services, restrained school funding and possible tax increases.In response, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider budget guidelines Monday that would limit the growth of most county government spending next year to 5.65 percent and limit the increase in county spending on schools to 6 percent. Those limits, however, would not erase the shortfall.The main reason for the shortfall, county officials said, is an expected continued decline in real estate taxes, which financed 60 percent of the county's $1.38 billion budget this year.James P. McDonald, deputy county executive for finances, said residential real estate values may face a 2 percent to 2.5 percent drop and commercial real estate values are expected to decrease by 5 percent. He cautioned, however, that the figures were preliminary and could change significantly if sales pick up in the next few months.""I'm convinced in my own mind there needs to be some modest tax rate increase, because the county can't provide the level of services that citizens demand,"" said Ed Hoole, chairman of the Citizen Budget Overview Committee.

WASHINGTON -- Reversing a recent trend, consumers' incomes rose faster than their spending in January. But Americans are still reaching for their wallets more than Federal Reserve decision makers would like.Personal income jumped 0.7% last month while consumer spending rose 0.5%, the Commerce Department said. Adjusted for inflation, core consumer spending inched up just 0.3%. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was unchanged at 0.2%. The savings rate bounced back to 1.4% after hitting a record low of 1% in December.The numbers, which suggest Americans are thinking twice about some purchases, represent an about-face from December when personal income grew just 0.3% and consumer spending surged a revised 1.1%. Core consumer spending climbed 0.9%.The increase in personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, was boosted by pay increases for federal civilian and military personnel, agricultural subsidies, and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Excluding the special factors, such as a 1.3% rise in government wage expenditures, the largest monthly gain since January 1993, income would have advanced 0.6%.Still, consumer spending, an important driver of the nation's economy, shows few real signs that it's easing up.

The Treasury Department is not worried that the weakening dollar, which makes U.S. assets less attractive, will affect the level of foreign demand for government securities, a Treasury official said yesterday.The official, Charles O. Sethness, assistant secretary for domestic finance, also said Treasury plans to sell $29 billion in new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to raise $14.3 billion in new cash and refund $14.7 billion of publicly held coupon securities maturing on Feb. 15.Some financial market analysts had expressed concern during the past few weeks that the sharp dip in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen would make U.S. Treasury securities less attractive to Japanese investors, requiring the Treasury to bid up interest rates on those issues to lure foreigners back.A weaker dollar means that foreigners earn less on their investments when their profits are converted into their own currencies. The government needs foreign participation in its securities to finance the deficit.The government said in a special budget supplement issued yesterday that the proportion of federal debt held by foreigners has actually declined compared to the late 1970s and early 1980s. For example, foreigners held 19 percent of U.S. debt in 1979, compared with 15 percent last year.

1242,"Recession's Hidden Virtues. We are all waiting, it seems, for the next recession. Everyone knows that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and so another recession is inevitable. Some indicators suggest that it might be sooner rather than later. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index has declined for three straight months. In March, 30 percent of respondents said jobs are ""plentiful""; now that's only 24 percent. All this inspires much foreboding, because a recession is widely regarded as a calamity or something close to it.Just last week, the Federal Reserve cut its key overnight interest rate for the second time since August. It now stands at 4.5 percent, down from its recent peak of 5.25 percent. Although the economy grew at a strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, most economists regard this as an aberration. They expect slower growth or a recession, because three powerful forces are assaulting the economic expansion.First, housing. Its collapse deepens. Economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley notes that sales of new and existing homes have dropped 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks of more than two years ago. As supplies of unsold homes grow, real estate prices continue to fall. One index finds that prices in August were down 4.4 percent nationally from a year earlier.Second, oil prices. They're approaching $100 a barrel. Even before the latest price increases, energy costs rose to 6.2 percent of consumer spending in the second quarter; that's up from 4.5 percent in 2002, notes consultant Jack Lavery, a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch. Higher energy costs will continue to weaken purchasing power for other goods and services, he says.Third, credit problems. As lenders and investors have suffered losses on subprime mortgages -- loans to weaker borrowers -- they've tightened lending standards for other borrowers. With the economy slowing, Diane Vazza of Standard & Poor's expects bond defaults to rise among shakier corporate borrowers, especially companies dependent on strong consumer spending (retailers, fast-food chains, entertainment firms).",1,0.33330000000000004,0.6667,1925

Rising rates and a banner year for stocks could lift earnings at some large companies that have made an arcane but significant change to the way their pension plans are valued.Companies including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. could show stronger results than some expect when they report fourth-quarter earnings in coming weeks. They and about 30 other companies in the past few years switched to ""mark-to-market"" pension accounting to make it easier for investors to gauge plan performance.With the switch, pension gains and losses flow into earnings sooner than under the old rules, which are still in effect and allow companies to smooth out the impact over several years. Companies that switch to valuing assets at up-to-date market prices may incur more volatility in their earnings, but it offers a more current picture of a pension plan's health and its contribution to the bottom line.In 2011 and 2012, that change hurt the companies' earnings, largely because interest rates were falling at the time. But for 2013, it may be a big help to them, accounting experts said, a factor of the year's surge in interest rates and strong stock-market performance.""It's going to account for a huge rise in operating earnings"" at the affected companies, said Dan Mahoney, director of research at accounting-research firm CFRA.",1,0.3608,0.6392,1927

OPEC has held oil prices steady this year but, as you doubtless saw, intends to raise them 14.5 percent in the coming year. By an instructive coincidence, 14.5 percent is just about the average increase in steel prices over the past year, and there is more to come in January.This disproportionately fast run-up in steel prices is the resultUOunintentional, but realUOof the Carter administrationUas attempts to protect the U.S. steel industry from its foreign competitors. The American producers had been complaining that the foreign mills were selling steel here below cost, to avoid unemployment at home. That's called dumping, and itUas illegal. Just about a year ago, the Treasury Department announced its trigger price system. It calculated the real cost of making steel in the most efficient millsUOJapanUasUOand any steel imported below that price was to trigger ail immediate dumping investigation. It was an ingenious idea. Unfortunately, it did not foresee the drastic rise in the value of the Japanese yen throughout 1978.As the yen soared, it took the trigger prices up \v ith it. Knowing that their foreign competitors would not come into this country below the trigger price, the American companies raised their own prices right along with the triggers. The trigger system became, in a manner of speaking, price controls in reverse. Instead of a ceiling holding prices down, for the American producers it provided a floor under pricesUOand, as in an elevator, the floor was rising. The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.reaction to the closing of steel mills in OhioUas Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. ItUas the first of four increments scheduled for 1979. On the same day, the Treasury has announced, the steel trigger prices will go up another 7 percent under the automatic formula.

After years of skyrocketing increases, national health care spending rose only 6.4 percent in 1994, the ""slowest growth rate recorded in more than three decades,"" the Medicare Office of National Health Statistics reported yesterday.The figures, published in the magazine Health Affairs, show that health spending by all public and private sources totaled $949.4 billion in calendar year 1994, the latest year for which data have been calculated, or $3,510 for each person in the United States.From 1988 to 1992 the nation experienced double-digit and near-double-digit increases in health spending each year. The rate eased to 7 percent in 1993 and the growth rate now has fallen again to 6.4 percent. Despite the small 1994 rise, U.S. health spending still makes up a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other developed nation's, 13.7 percent in 1994.Authors Katharine Levit, Helen Lazenby and Lekha Sivarajan said the slow rate of increase appears to stem from employers switching coverage for their workers from conventional fee-for-service plans to health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans that often charge less. Low inflation also is a contributing factor.The new figures appear to support the arguments of health analysts like Gail Wilensky, who chairs the Congressional Physician Payment Review Commission, and GOP members of Congress, like Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), who believe that increasing competition in the health industry is squeezing waste and holding down cost growth.",1,0.3379,0.6621,2026
1262,"The Outlook: Capital Spending Will Boost Recovery. NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity.",1,0.0,1.0,2036

The two-day loss erased all the gains made last Thursday when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker confirmed that the Fed was pushing up short-term interest rates to help stabilize the dollar.Traders said the bond market was rife with rumors about how active Japanese investors would be in the government's quarterly refunding operation, which begins today.

Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""Economic activity is picking up, the inflation rate is rising, and there's no clear evidence that the U.S. is prepared to defend the dollar at its current level. For a foreign investor, there's a currency risk as well as an inflation risk in buying bonds.""But another analyst, who requested anonymity, said he believes Japanese will be buyers in the refunding. ""It makes a lot of sense for them to be in it, and it also makes sense for them to pooh-pooh it beforehand,"" he said. ""It's to their advantage to do the most surprising thing.

1268,"Wary Car Firms Plan Cutbacks In 4th Quarter --- Year-End Output Forecasters, Lowest Since '82, Reflect Fears of Possible Slump. DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers, in a mood of caution, are planning to build fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than in any last quarter since the recession-plagued final period of 1982.While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's ""soft landing"" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. ""The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery,"" said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years.",1,0.0,1.0,2070

MeltzerWould the late Milton Friedman have endorsed the Federal Reserve's plan to make large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury bonds? The idea here is to pump more money into and thus jump-start the economy, reducing unemployment. Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program. I am certain he would not.Friedman's main message for central banks was to maintain a monetary rule that kept the growth of the money supply constant. In his Newsweek column, ""Inflation and Jobs"" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that ""unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,"" so that if a central bank ""cured"" unemployment by inflating, it ""will have unemployment later."" In other words, don't try it.Friedman's Newsweek column for July 28, 1980 (""Improving Monetary Policy"") came with the unemployment rate rising past 7%. His proposals for improving policy made no mention of using monetary expansion to reduce unemployment. He proposed rules for stable growth to achieve target ""dollar levels of monetary aggregates.""Friedman served on President Reagan's economic policy advisory board. His memos on monetary policy repeat the themes he made familiar to Newsweek readers and others all over the world. There is not a word suggesting that monetary policy should try to raise the inflation rate in order to reduce the unemployment rate.",1,0.3198,0.6802,2075
1270,"The Fed's Blueprint for Financial Control; Dan Tarullo's recent speech suggests that the central bank is intent on wide regulation of U.S. capital markets.. Much of the financial world hangs on Janet Yellen's every word, looking for policy portents in language that is crafted to be circumspect about the central bank's plans. A more useful place to look for guidance on regulation of the financial system is Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor and its point man for banking reform. Mr. Tarullo gave a speech in Chicago on May 8 that was as unsettling as it was, by the Fed's inscrutable standards, unguarded.Addressing the Chicago Fed Bank Structure Conference, Mr. Tarullo proposed that the central bank must ""broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors."" This expansion of regulatory authority would take the Fed far beyond the current power it exercises thanks to the Dodd-Frank law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises. The casualties of such an expansion could include small- and medium-size banks.Under Dodd-Frank, ultimate financial regulatory power resides with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a council of 10 regulators chaired by the Treasury and which includes the Fed chairman. The FSOC can designate asset managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, or even broker-dealers as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a classification that puts an institution under the Fed's regulatory authority. The council has already designated the large insurers AIG and Prudential as SIFIs, and it has many more nonbank financial companies in its sights.The council's moves are part of a larger blueprint that Mr. Tarullo has now laid out. In the Chicago speech, he proposed ditching complex Basel III capital and liquidity regulations and reducing regulations on small banks. The new system he outlined would use simpler, Basel I capital charges for small banks, on grounds that the failure of these banks would pose no threat to financial stability. Larger regional banks would require slightly elevated regulatory standards, but nothing too complex.Once a bank joins a ""club"" of the 80 largest institutions, however, the Federal Reserve should be its regulator, Mr. Tarullo said, and regulation should focus on annual stress tests. The very largest institutions, U.S. global banks and nonbank SIFIs, would receive the most intrusive Fed oversight and be required to satisfy the full range of new international macroprudential rules.",1,0.34430000000000005,0.6557,2076

Economy watchers, trying to triangulate the economy's position amid credit risks and the housing slump, found fresh numbers and economic utterances to crunch and parse today.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- which publishes comparable social and economic stats for some 30 countries -- reported Wednesday that the U.S. economic slowdown will be significant, as the real estate crisis continues. Housing ""is set to exert a longer and more potent than expected drag"" on the U.S. economy, said Jean-Philippe Cotis, chief economist for the Paris-based economic think tank. Consumers will also be tested by ""mortgage rate resets, tighter credit standards, weaker collaterals and slower job creation."" In a press briefing, Mr. Costis also said he expects the Federal Reserve to ease rates sooner rather than later. Another ominous, yet inconclusive, indicator of the direction of the U.S. economy out early Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report, said that jobs in the private sector rose by 38,000 in August, much less than expectations. This data tidbit shined one of the first statistical spotlights on the economy in August, when the worries over exposure to subprime securities spooked investors out of credit markets. Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned that the ADP report ""gives a picture of the labor market for the week of Aug. 12, only part way through the market turmoil and before employment could really react to the ongoing credit crunch. More weakness could well be yet to come.""Also out Wednesday were housing numbers from the National Association of Realtors. The group's index of pending sales of existing homes decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2% in July from June, the industry group said Wednesday. The NAR index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 16.1% below the level of July 2006. An NAR statement accompanying the data release also suggested existing-home sales will likely sag more as mortgage disruptions tied to credit concerns work their way into the housing market. BNP Paribas economists noted that ""most worryingly is that this report is clearly 'pre-turmoil', reflecting resale transactions agreed in July, so before August's financial market turmoil, lurch higher in jumbo mortgage rates and the freezing over of much of the mortgage market. How bad next month's pending sales index (and this month's new home sales report) might be is really quite frightening."" Still more economic reports are on tap for later today, when the Federal Reserve will release its ""beige book"" report. Concerns over the credit crunch and statements from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week will put extra weight on the regularly published collection of on-the-ground business anecdotes from the Fed's 12 regional banks.Housing figures proved particularly difficult for investors to digest, and major indexes reversed course after Tuesday's rally.

That was significantly higher than last year's April deficit of $20 billion and above the $30 billion deficit that private-sector economists had expected.The government generally runs surpluses in April, as millions of taxpayers file their income tax returns. But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps.

Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods.",1,0.0,1.0,2145

1282,"Gold's Fate May Rest With Fed. Author: Rhiannon HoyleThe price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction.",1,0.3077,0.6923,2173

Will war benefit home sellers in Los Angeles? And how much more expensive will homes nationally be this year than last?The answers: Yes, maybe and just a bit, according to the most recent Home Price Forecast done by Case Shiller Weiss, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, for The Wall Street Journal. But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up. Home prices nationally will once again climb over the coming year, by an average of 2.8%. In fact, out of the 20 cities tracked, only two won't see prices rise, the forecasters say.Still, the upswing will be remarkably varied across the country, with some cities, such as San Diego, barely squeaking ahead (prices are expected to go up by just 0.8% there), while others, like Washington, D.C., should boast a robust jump of more than 7%. And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year. ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" says the firm's Karl Case, who takes into account past sale prices, the number of homes on the market and the number of people setting up new households when making his predictions.Patrick and Sharon Brem discovered that for themselves when they recently tried to sell their loft in downtown San Francisco.

Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine. ""The buildup of precautionary inventories ahead of Y2K probably pulled in a few more exports during the fourth quarter,"" said Mark Vitner, economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.

WASHINGTON--The breakdown in deficit-reduction talks between the White House and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) could immediately increase the risk that Standard & Poor's takes the unprecedented step of lowering its top-notch rating of U.S. government debt.The credit-rating firm has warned repeatedly that it could move to downgrade U.S. debt if it believes any deficit-reduction deal isn't robust enough to change the country's trajectory of future debt growth. A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening.""If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need,"" Mr. Obama said Friday evening.",1,0.0,1.0,2236

The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families.

SchiffMost economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.",1,0.0,1.0,2305

Usually, the bond encounters strong market resistance in moving below 8 percent.Why has it been difficult for the long bond to move down through 8 percent, and what will it take for long rates to fall to the low levels of 1987? The answers hinge on inflation and the recovery.We have to go back to the first quarter of 1987 to find yields at those low levels, prior to the three recent instances. At that time, the bond traded at 7.27 percent to 7.88 percent, with the lower yields occurring in January 1987. Then, as the economy began to improve and inflation began to rise, rates rose until Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.Inflation is the first part of the answer. The consumer price index, a widely followed measure of inflation, rose a mere 1.1 percent from December 1985 to December 1986, helped by a 30.7 percent decline in energy costs. The CPI was up only 3.8 percent the previous year.As a result of two good inflation years back to back, interest rates began to trend lower in February 1986, touching briefly at 7.16 percent in July, and then ambulating between 7.16 percent and 7.77 percent before closing the year at 7.33 percent.

Borrowing for U.S. colleges declined for the third year in a row as the federal government clamped down on for-profit schools and families became more cost-conscious.Federal and private-loan lending totaled $106 billion for the 2013-14 academic year, down 8% from the prior year, according to a report to be released Thursday by the nonprofit College Board. The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say. A growing share of students are commuting from home rather than living on campus, for example, according to a report issued earlier this year by SLM Corp., the largest private student lender, also known as Sallie Mae.An improving economy and stock market are also likely contributing to families borrowing less, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, a Las Vegas-based firm that tracks financial aid and student loans.

WASHINGTON -- Surging imports from Europe and Japan caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to $10.29 billion in January from $8.03 billion the previous month, the Commerce Department said.The widening in January came despite a 3.3% decline in the value of petroleum imports, which are often volatile. Total imports rose 9.2%.The large January deficit makes it clear that the easing of the nation's trade problems at the end of last year was temporary, reflecting a slowdown in imports as a result of sluggish economic growth in the third quarter.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the 10% rise in the value of the dollar last year, plus the 9% jump since December, could push the deficit to a record $140 billion this year. The trade deficit in 1984 was a record $123.31 billion, compared with $69.39 billion in 1983, the previous record.A strong dollar can widen the trade deficit by lowering the cost of imports to U.S. buyers and raising the cost of exports to foreign buyers.

Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount ""What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs,"" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been ""more than I anticipated."" On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal.

In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression.

The food index dropped 1.4 percent, because of falling prices for meat and vegetables, and the energy index fell 1 percent mainly because of a steep decline in heating oil prices.But even the ""core"" index, which excludes food and energy, was flat in February, underscoring the remarkable absence of inflationary pressures in the robust U.S. economy.",1,0.0,1.0,2452

Transportation prices fell 0.6% as airline fares and new-car prices dropped.

Many economists expect that number to exceed a 4% annual rate, compared with 2.2% in the first quarter -- well above the level thought to be sustainable without higher inflation, given today's tight labor markets.In their deliberations, Fed policy makers had to look ahead into next year and would have tightened rates if they saw a clear threat of unsustainable growth leading to rising inflation.

1348,"The Outlook: Recession-Free 1988? Don't Bet the Ranch. NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record.

1351,"There's No Escaping Hauser's Law. Even amoebas learn by trial and error, but some economists and politicians do not. The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%. Yet taxes as a share of GDP have remained within a relatively narrow range as a percent of GDP in the entire post-World War II period.",1,0.3077,0.6923,2566

FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. reported an 8.6% increase in third-quarter earnings as ""longer cycle"" businesses offset softness in other areas.The electrical and consumer products, broadcasting and financial services concern said net income rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.16 a share, from $945 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.2% to $14.2 billion from $13 billion.Per-share earnings were up 12%, partly reflecting purchases by the company of 12 million of its shares during the quarter. GE had 878 million shares outstanding Sept. 30, compared with 906.4 million a year earlier. GE has bought back 35 million shares since its share-purchase program began in November.GE Chairman John F.

1377,"Builders Dangle Cheap Financing; In the Face of Rising Interest Rates, Developers Are Offering New Incentives to Keep Houses Moving. WHEN AUTO makers wanted to keep cars moving off dealers' lots, they offered zero-percent financing. Now some home builders, worried that rising interest rates may clip the pace of new sales, have gotten into the act by making cheaper financing available to home buyers.While the builders aren't offering no-interest loans, in some areas they are undercutting the rates offered by more traditional lenders. To entice buyers, big national builders such as KB Homes and smaller developers such as Estridge Companies in Carmel, Ind., are providing incentives ranging from below-market loans to offers to lock in low rates for up to six months.In formerly hot markets like Denver and Austin, Texas, builders are sweetening financing deals, paying as much as $4,000 on a $200,000 mortgage to cover a buyer's closing costs.Rising rates are expected to play an increasingly important role in the housing market during coming months. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates for the second time in two months and further increases are expected this year. While mortgage rates don't move directly in tandem with moves by the Fed, they are expected to rise as the Fed continues to rachet up rates.The financial enticements from home builders are a relatively new but growing practice that the Fed highlighted last month in its ""beige book"" economic report. In response to rising rates, builders are ""altering their financing products accordingly in an attempt to make them more attractive,"" the Fed noted.",1,0.33609999999999995,0.6639,2720

Many gold bugs see inflation returning, and with it, coin buying. Some feel the introduction of the American gold coin will also revive the market. It will act ""like an injection of vitamins"" into the U.S. gold market, says Mr. Vigdor.For prospective coin buyers, the most important consideration is a coin's liquidity.

Most short-term interest rates declined. Traders were ""almost euphoric"" as rumors of an impending oil-price reduction swirled through the credit markets, said Donald E.

A majority of executives surveyed said they expect a ""virtually uninterrupted period of depressed demand"" for oil over the next 18 months or more.Even without a reduction in oil prices, many analysts expect lower interest rates.

Cars and houses are selling better, shoppers are loosening their purse strings and more people are being put to work.

Nevada had the second fastest growth rate at 25%, followed by Idaho at 24%.For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, those three states plus Wyoming ranked among the top 10 in food-stamp growth, with Idaho leading with a 42% jump from 2009, according to USDA figures.It's a striking shift for the area, reflecting a post-boom fallout that has been compounded by the many new residents drawn to the region by a hot economy who lacked a support network when jobs disappeared.""This is a pick-you-up-by-the-bootstraps type of state, which is why the food-stamp participation has [historically] been low,"" said Rose Andueza, program manager of Idaho's Division of Welfare.

1400,"What We Could Learn From Mexico. The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components.",1,0.0,1.0,2831

The economy has been expanding for 27 consecutive quarters. Over the past year, the stock market peaked and consumer confidence reached its highest level in 28 years. Mortgage interest and unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in decades. Real wages -- at least for the better-off -- are rising, and government coffers are overflowing. Even crime rates are down.So it is only natural that home sales are breaking records and prices are beating inflation.That's the conclusion of the latest Home Price Forecast, prepared for The Wall Street Journal by the economic research firm Case Shiller Weiss Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The forecast reflects actual price changes in 10 of the largest metropolitan areas from August 1996 to August 1997 and projects figures to January 1999.Not everyone feels like celebrating, however. In Chicago, where the economists predict the lowest price rises of the 10 metro areas, home prices are just keeping pace with inflation and houses are languishing on the market.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly to $6.79 billion in September, the Commerce Department said, with modest increases in both exports and imports.The Commerce Department said exports increased by 2.9% to $35.43 billion in September while imports rose by 3.2% to $42.22 billion. The August deficit was $6.53 billion.The Bush administration hailed the news as an indication of economic recovery. ""The slight increase in the overall deficit reflected a growing U.S. economy, with strong purchases by Americans of consumer and capital goods,"" said Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher in a statement. ""With three quarters of 1991 in the bank, a very good trade year is shaping up.""But several private economists suggested Mr. Mosbacher's analysis was overly optimistic, particularly on the import side. Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York, said the growth in imports doesn't really reflect a pickup in consumer demand, but rather the purchase of previously ordered goods. ""Unfortunately, most of the increase in imports was in retail inventories, {orders made} when people thought the recession was over,"" said Mr. Steinberg.Other government reports suggest that increases in domestic demand noticed earlier in the year have begun to taper off.",1,0.3077,0.6923,2847

1410,"Bush's Real Challenge: Rebuilding The Economy. IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House.

For America's 44 million senior citizens, plus tens of millions of others who are on the threshold of retirement, last month marked a watershed moment that is worth celebrating. At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy.",1,0.0,1.0,2891

NEW YORK -- Most interest rates declined yesterday, amid widespread speculation that the Federal Reserve System will ease credit conditions further in an attempt to bolster the economy.A sharp drop in oil prices, coupled with the decline in short-term rates, helped drive up bond prices. Some actively traded Treasury bonds rose about a point, or around $10 for each $1,000 face amount.Rates at the Treasury's weekly bill auction tumbled to their lowest levels in more than eight and a half years. The rate on new 13-week bills averaged 5.84%, compared with 6.19% at last week's sale. That was the lowest since Sept. 2, 1977, when similar bills sold at an average rate of 5.554%. The average rate on new 26-week bills fell to 5.93% from 6.17% and was the lowest since a 5.845% rate, also set at the Sept. 2, 1977 sale.Many analysts say government figures to be released this week will show the economy remained weak in the first quarter. This, they contend, will prod the Fed to push interest rates down further. ""It's just about engraved in stone that we're going to get a discount rate cut soon,"" said Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International.""The Fed will cut the discount rate to 6 1/2%"" shortly, agreed Lawrence N. Leuzzi, an economist at S.G.

Things didn't look so good for Northview a year ago, when its chairman, Ivan Boesky, came under fire for his misdeeds on Wall Street. But Mr. Boesky quit his Northview job, and in the fourth quarter, new management negotiated a takeover of the company by Calmark Financial, simultaneous to a self-tender by Northview of all its stock outstanding.Such winners are a bit on the esoteric side, though. Citizens Insurance's yearly revenue amounts to just $7 million, according to Media General's databank.

In a separate report released yesterday, the department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to a record $19.22 billion in November.Mr. Brown said manufactured exports are expected to grow faster than imports for the first time since 1980.

When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven.",1,0.3078,0.6922,3038

1453,"Board of Contributors: Goose the Money Supply. When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.",1,0.35650000000000004,0.6435,3056

The Clinton administration, alarmed that the declining dollar threatens its hopes for the U.S. economy, led a 16-nation offensive to prop up the currency.As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared unequivocally for the first time that the dollar has fallen too far, the U.S. recruited allies ranging from Germany to Portugal to buy dollars in the most-coordinated show of force that currency markets have seen in a decade.The intervention met with modest initial success, but the markets are sure to test the dollar again. And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to ""disorderly"" markets and ""volatility,"" Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves ""reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals."" Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: ""This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.""Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar.

When the recession started in July 1990, hourly earnings were running 4% above the year before. Now, hourly pay is only 2.5% above year-earlier levels. For the full year, analysts widely predict that labor costs will rise less than the 4.4% increase of 1991.Many inflation optimists peg their good mood on wage costs. ""With nominal wage increases gradually easing . . . the odds of seeing a further gradual reduction in the core rate of inflation are quite favorable,"" says Federal Reserve Board Gov.

Paris -- TO PARAPHRASE the title of the Jack Nicholson movie: Is this as good as it gets?To many, it looked that way for the dollar late last month, when the U.S. currency staged a brief comeback after its long and steep decline against the world's other currencies, especially the euro. The dollar at one point climbed to $1.2338 to the euro from an all-time low of $1.2897, set earlier in January.Many sages said the time was just ripe for a brief dollar recovery and that the dollar's downward creep would continue soon afterward. The dollar's brief boost, they say, was simply caused by European officials jawboning in its favor, the Federal Reserve hinting that U.S. interest rates could be headed higher and finance officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations preparing for their meeting this weekend.Indeed, that consensus appeared to be right when the dollar's decline started again a little less than two weeks ago. In late New York trading yesterday, the euro was changing hands at $1.2545, less than 3% below its record high. After all, ""nothing much has changed in underlying fundamentals,"" says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at consulting firm High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.Is that consensus too pessimistic about the dollar's prospects?

A quirky mix of assets and markets world-wide has benefited from the simultaneous plunge of crude oil and the U.S. dollar, and strategists are pushing advice that hinges on the continuation of those trends.No surprise, other commodities besides oil have rallied on the dollar's woes, as have overseas investments, especially companies that produce or sell natural resources. The Dow Jones Japan Financial Index and Dow Jones World Basic Materials Index each gained more than 9% last week. Since November, the Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of shipping costs closely linked to raw-material prices, has jumped nearly 25% to 6134. Gold futures are up 6.6% over the same period to $457.80 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.But stock sectors usually associated with more-aggressive investment strategies, such as technology, have also benefited: The Dow Jones World Technology Index gained almost 8% last week. And the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.2%, up 8.8% since November, to 2147.96.The upshot, many analysts say, is that investors are betting not just on a continuation of world economic recovery and U.S. dollar weakness, but they are also doing so in especially hard-charging fashion.

The latest readings on U.S. housing and business investment confounded economists' expectations, but the underlying trends still show the economy acting pretty much as Federal Reserve officials had hoped: Perhaps slowing, but not sinking.In two separate reports, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose and businesses' orders for capital goods dropped in April. At first glance, that's at odds with the Fed's main scenario for what the economy will do this year: Consumer spending should slow as a weakening housing market makes people feel poorer, but increased business investment -- in the form of capital-goods purchases and hiring -- should help keep the deceleration from becoming a disaster.Economists, however, warned against reading too much into the volatile monthly data, saying that longer-term trends still point toward slowing home sales and growing capital spending. ""We all agree that the housing market is cooling off, and some other sector of the economy must take the burden of keeping growth healthy,"" said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ""Capital spending is a prime candidate.""New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in Southern states. The number contrasted sharply with expectations of an April drop in home sales, but downward revisions to the previous months' numbers lessened the surprise. After revisions, the rate of new-home sales dropped 7.6% over the first three months of 2006, compared with a previous estimate of 4.2%. April's rate of sales was still 12.4% below the most recent peak in July 2005.""The overall picture is one of a cooling housing market,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. a New York consultancy.

1481,"Short-Term Rates Rise and Bond Prices Slump Despite Decline in Money Supply. NEW YORK -- Most short-term interest rates climbed yesterday, adding to uncertainty about the Federal Reserve System's credit policy and sending a chill through the bond market.Even an unexpected decline of $300 million in the nation's money supply, reported by the Fed yesterday afternoon, did little to rejuvenate the credit markets. Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. ""People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,"" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. ""The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.""The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday.

Such an easing would lead to lower U.S. interest rates which, in turn, would tend to weaken the dollar. The minutes were released late Friday.Then later in Washington, Treasury Secretary James Baker, in remarks before a global-monetary conference, said that the endeavor by the so-called Group of Five -- U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- to lower the dollar wasn't ""a one-shot"" effort.

The benchmark 10-year note dropped to a five-month intraday low last Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered an intraday drop of nearly 1,000 points.The latest week was the fifth in a row that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages fell, noted Freddie Chief Economist Frank Nothaft.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.93% for the week ended Thursday, down from last week's 5% average but up from 4.86% a year ago. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.3%, compared with 4.36% and 4.27%, respectively.Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 3.95%, a low since Freddie began tracking such mortgages in early 2005, down from last week's 3.97% and 4.82% a year earlier.

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said that inflation isn't accelerating and that the economy is doing better than most forecasters predicted.In a speech to a group of business executives, Mr. Greenspan said recent interest rate increases in the financial markets reflect fears of a pickup in inflation, conceding that there is ""an implicit rise in the inflation rate embodied in long-term (interest) rates."" But he restated his view that the markets are expecting something that is in the ""lower probabilities"" of the likely outcomes.The Fed chief said that signs of shortages that would lead to a pickup in inflation are likely to show up first in a lengthening of the delivery times for raw materials. Such delays aren't showing up across the board, he said, indicating that the economy isn't ""approaching full capacity.""He said that a recent ""dramatic rise in steel scrap prices"" and higher prices for other commodities reflect increased demand as the basic industrial sector of the economy revives, rather than an acceleration in inflation.Mr. Greenspan said this revival has been due partly to an ""extraordinary shift currently under way"" in the nation's trade balance, as exports rise and domestic producers gain an increasing share of the U.S. market. He conceded that the turnaround still hasn't shown up in the nominal trade figures, as higher import prices continue to push up the dollar value of the nation's import bill.",1,0.0,1.0,3272
1496,"The Outlook: The Fed May Be Getting Into a Box. NEW YORK -- The economy continues to edge higher, and the consensus forecast is that the gains will continue, at least through 1988. The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be ""acceptable."" It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?",1,0.3509,0.6491,3273

The trading also reflects widely held expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will soon lower short-term U.S. rates even further to fight an incipient recession.""The best thing that could happen now for the United States,"" said foreign exchange expert Geoffrey Bell of the New York company bearing his name, ""is a falling dollar that would work against recession by improving exports and reducing imports.""At the close of trading in Europe, the dollar was down to 1.5605 marks, compared with 1.5685 on Tuesday.

NEW YORK -- Bond prices rose sharply yesterday after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker expressed concern about sluggishness in the economy's manufacturing sectors.Traders interpreted Mr. Volcker's remarks as an indication that the Fed won't tighten its credit policy. Some analysts say the Fed may even loosen its credit grip and push down interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.Prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Most short-term interest rates fell.The rally erased the sharp declines in bond prices registered Monday when the markets were jolted by the collapse of a small securities firm. The company, Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corp. in Livingston, N.J., was placed under bankruptcy-law protection.

So-called safe-harbor flows have meant strong currents for the U.S. Treasurys market throughout the credit-market shakeout.Now it looks like their absence could leave investors flailing. The Federal Reserve's efforts to keep cash moving in the financial system have stopped short of the sort of interest-rate cut the market craves, but they have weighed on Treasurys nevertheless. The question is how much government bonds will suffer from any turnaround in the credit and stock markets.Friday, the Fed cut the borrowing rate on its discount window to 5.75% and extended the term from overnight to 30 days, with the option to renew. The central bank left the key federal-funds rate untouched at 5.25%.It was enough to prompt a significant drop in prices of long-dated Treasurys. The benchmark 10-year note fell 19/32 point, lifting its yield to 4.673%, as debt prices and yields move inversely. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.8%.The feeling in the market now is that it isn't so much a question of whether the Fed will cut the fed-funds rate, but when it will do so. According to Credit Suisse, it is a matter of strategy alone; an early cut risks overstepping the mark and forcing an adjustment down the line, with all the attendant volatility and potential damage to the bank's credibility.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly deteriorated in April, swelling to $11.37 billion from $9.79 billion in March, the Commerce Department said.The poor showing casts a bigger cloud over the economy and prompted some economists to again lower their forecast for economic growth in the current quarter, which ends next week.""The chance of negative second-quarter gross domestic product rises as trade worsens,"" said Joseph Liro, chief economist of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. Gross domestic product is the value of goods and services produced in the U.S.The widening trade gap was attributed to an increase in imports of computers, cars and other consumer goods and a decline in exports of telecommunications equipment and industrial supplies.Although the trade surplus with Japan actually improved slightly -- narrowing to $5.87 billion in April from $6.14 billion the month before -- imports of new Japanese cars to the U.S. grew to $2.4 billion. That was the second-highest figure on record and a point that is certain to put additional pressure on the Clinton administration to keep a tough stance in its battle to force Japan to open its markets to American-made autos and auto parts.

WASHINGTON -- In a sign that inflation remains under control even as the economy regains momentum, prices at the wholesale level dropped 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said.The fall in the producer price index was caused by a big 1.5% drop in energy costs, reflecting the recent weakness in crude oil prices, and a 0.5% decline in food prices. Excluding these volatile sectors, producer prices edged up 0.1% in November after dropping 0.1% the month before.

With the unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in June from 6.3% in May, several economists brought forward forecasts for when the first rate increase will come. Federal-funds futures, which price off Fed policy expectations, imply the target rate will be 0.5% by August 2015 versus near-zero today.But there still is a great deal of uncertainty on when ""liftoff,"" as Fed policy makers call it, will occur. That is largely because the unemployment rate doesn't seem to be fully capturing how much slack remains in the job market.There is no way to know how many of the people who left the labor force during the recession and its aftermath, and who therefore aren't counted among the unemployed, will return to the job hunt.

WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.",1,0.0,1.0,3337

With the economy expanding smartly, interest rates low and inflation in check, President Bush is sailing into the presidential election year with perhaps only a single dark economic cloud on the horizon: the shrinking U.S. dollar.Whether that cloud produces a nourishing rain shower -- in the form of swelling U.S. exports and a recovery of manufacturing jobs - - or a deluge of rising interest rates and soaring budget deficits is the subject of increasingly heated economic debate.Recent news of rapid third-quarter economic growth, rising consumer spending and climbing personal incomes did little to budge the dollar from its record lows against the 12-nation euro. The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets.

1519,"The Market's Frame of Mind. To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery.",1,0.3388,0.6612,3361

It was the third month in a row that the trade gap has widened, and placed it at its largest level in a year and a half.The May deficit is troublesome because of a substantial drop in exports, which have been largely credited with helping to lead the nation back to economic health.

The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it.

1536,"The Afternoon Report: Reckoning Rates. The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that ""the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed."" And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. ""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us.""

WASHINGTON--Major Wall Street banks said they will sell business lines, let the government take over certain subsidiaries and enter into bankruptcy proceedings to avoid a taxpayer-funded bailout in the event of another financial crisis.The latest round of so-called living wills, released by regulators Thursday, showcased the disparate approaches banks plan to take to dismantle their firms in times of severe market stress.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said its ""preferred strategy"" would be to avoid insolvency by recapitalizing its major U.S. and U.K. broker-dealers, as well as other key businesses. Citigroup Inc. would try to sell off its broker-dealer units first before letting the parent company fail under one scenario. Bank of America Corp. said the ""simplest approach"" to winding down its business would be through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its holding company, with its subsidiaries continuing to operate. If unable to recapitalize its business, J.P.

U.S. producers absorbed some of the pain of higher energy prices in April, and the housing market showed further signs of cooling, helping to quell fears inflation will spread to the broader economy.Wholesale prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline rose 4% in April, pushing up average prices on all finished goods -- everything from turkeys to tractors -- a greater-than-expected 0.9%, the Labor Department reported. But the closely watched ""core"" index of producer prices, which excludes energy and food, rose only 0.1%, well below expectations.""Given all the energy-price hikes coming through, that's still very subdued,"" said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist at consultancy Global Insight.Economists and investors watch wholesale prices closely as a signal of what may happen with the consumer-price index, a broader measure of inflation on which the government will report today.

Also, the economy appears to have been running a lot hotter in the first quarter than initially believed.

1552,"Golden warning. On Jan. 31, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it was lowering the federal-funds rate and the discount rate by one-quarter of 1%. In making the move, the Fed cited the moderation in economic growth and chose to ignore the warning of gold moving above $400 an ounce. As a consequence, the markets have given the Fed a very unsatisfactory grade for its latest rate cut. In the wake of this rate cut, the price of gold has pushed higher to $415 an ounce, long-term interest rates have moved higher, the yield curve has steepened, and the dollar has slipped against the mark and the yen. In other words, interest rates on bonds went up even though the cost of borrowing money fell. Bond investors said, in effect: Pay me more interest to bribe me to own the bonds.A rise in the price of gold is the best signal that we have to indicate that there is diminished confidence about the future purchasing-power reliability of money. The price of gold rises when the most savvy and suspicious investors believe the Fed has become a less reliable guardian of the value of our money. Or they may believe that in our democracy the president or Congress may pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. These suspicious investors would move out of dollars and into gold if they thought that the government was leaning on the Fed to lessen its commitment to price stability.Last week's interest rate cut raises questions about whether it might have been a politically motivated deal. It was unusual that the discount rate was cut by only one-quarter of 1% -- you have to go back to 1978 to see such a small change in the discount rate -- and yet six Fed banks (including all five of the banks whose presidents have an Federal Open Market Committee vote) requested the move. Based on minutes from the Dec. 19 FOMC meeting, there were some members who would have preferred to leave rates unchanged and were unsure, after the rate cut at that meeting, what the direction of the next rate move would be. Where were their voices at the January meeting? Remember, the term of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan runs out March 2, only eight months before the presidential election.On Jan. 31, the Fed ignored the warning signal from the 8% rise in the price of gold above the 1995 average. The Fed effectively said that even though there is some move out of dollars into gold, it will declare inflation to be satisfactory and give another small shove toward growth. Since the discount rate announcement, the price of gold has risen $11, to $415 an ounce; 30-year bonds have fallen two points in price, taking the yield up to 6.17% despite economic data that ought to have been favorable for bonds; and the dollar has fallen two yen, to 105 yen. Why was the immediate response to this monetary policy change so adverse?1. The rise in the price of gold was ignored by the Fed. Standing pat or doing nothing could have achieved a great deal. The Fed could have demonstrated its concern by leaving the funds rate unchanged at 5.5%. If the Fed had not ignored the signal, the suspicions that led to a preference for gold probably would have abated.",1,0.3214,0.6786,3542

1554,"The Dismal Science: The Best Way to Give Business a Boost. Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending.The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils: losses in the time value of money (a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised) and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages.",1,0.0,1.0,3562

The breaking-off of budget negotiations between President Reagan and congressional leaders yesterday leaves the nation facing a string of huge budget deficits and continuing high interest rates, with little chance for a sustained economic recovery anytime soon.Congress still could find some way to reduce the deficits. But, in the absence of major spending cuts and tax increases, interest rates are likely to stay so high that the important, housing and auto industries almost certainly will remain deeply depressed, according to a number of economists. The high rates also probably will lead businesses to keep cutting back their capital investment plans, the key to healthy, longterm economic growth.Murray L. Weidenbaum, ReaganUas chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the presidentUas February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down.

Author: Sudeep ReddyWASHINGTON--Federal Reserve officials acknowledged a housing-market bubble more than a year before U.S. house prices peaked, but they showed little inclination to address it, according to transcripts of their 2005 meetings released Friday.During 2005, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter-percentage point at every meeting, unwinding the ultra-loose policy it pursued earlier in the decade to address deflation worries after the 2001 recession. The economy at the time was growing at a healthy pace with few signs of overheating. But with reports across the U.S. indicating a bubble in the housing market, the Federal Open Market Committee spent time assessing the appreciation in home prices and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it. Fed staff economists had found that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20%, based on the historical relationship between prices and rents.But Fed officials appeared hamstrung because they believed their most important tool--interest rates--could not address frothy housing markets alone without influencing the broader economy.""I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble,"" said Fed Governor Edward Gramlich, who died in 2007.

With slowing housing demand, Wall Street thought that would make it easier for the Fed to stop raising rates soon.A surge in big-ticket factory orders raised questions, however, about whether demand would hold steady, possibly increasing pricing pressure and the chance for higher inflation. The Fed meets Monday and Tuesday, and it is expected to raise the nation's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent.While questions remain as to how many more rate increases the Fed will implement, analysts believe stocks still have room to move higher, thanks to a decent economy and the chance for another quarter of strong corporate earnings.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.68, or 0.1 percent, to 11,279.97.

The idea that American manufacturing is on the cusp of a renaissance is everywhere these days -- except in the hard numbers.It's true that industrial production has grown twice as fast as the economy as a whole in this recovery, and manufacturers are adding jobs again. But economists see those gains as too small relative to what was lost in previous years to suggest a full-blown revival.

Simply put, America's factories are dying faster than they're being born.To be sure, many U.S. manufacturers are doing better than they have in some time. That's visible in hiring. Manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since early 2010, and Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management is expected to show manufacturers continued expanding in March.

Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers.

WASHINGTON -- The February decline in the unemployment rate masks continuing problems among the nation's manufacturers.The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 7.3% of the work force last month from 7.4% in January, the Labor Department said. But it took a large rise in services employment to offset substantial declines in manufacturing and construction employment, according to the department's survey of business payrolls. The average hours of factory workers also dropped, to 40.0 a week from 40.6. Together, the numbers suggest industrial production actually fell in the month.Analysts believe some of the decline in manufacturing and construction may have been tied to harsh weather during February. But the numbers also seem to suggest that manufacturers have yet to fully recover from the sluggish growth that occurred in last year's third quarter.""The decline in manufacturing reflects the overbuilding of inventories in late 1984 and increased import penetration as a result of the rapid escalation of the dollar,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.Companies should be able to work off excess inventories in the next month or two.

The jobless rate remains stuck just below 10% with little respite in sight. The housing market is still very weak, and is enduring further shocks as lenders' foreclosure problems keep getting worse.

And the global recovery is uneven enough that the Federal Reserve is thinking of yet more extraordinary measures to get things rolling.Even with those headwinds, the mood among stock investors as we near the end of October is surprisingly upbeat.

1585,"The Great Terror; A massive new history of Hitler's tyranny.. Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence.",1,0.33330000000000004,0.6667,3763

The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come.

The Asian financial crisis began to exert a serious drag on U.S. exports in January, according to a Commerce Department report issued yesterday. The lower exports helped drive the United States' trade deficit for that month to a record $12 billion.The downturn in sales of American goods to Asia, which economists have anticipated ever since the region's financial markets collapsed last fall, has manifested itself up to now mainly in anecdotes about individual U.S. firms losing business.But with yesterday's report ""it's undeniable that the effect of the crisis is in the data,"" said David Hensley, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York.Hensley cited exports to South Korea, which plunged to $1.096 billion in January from $1.680 billion the previous month. ""The level is all the way down to 1993 levels, so we've essentially given back in a few months about four years of export growth,"" he said.Commerce Secretary William Daley agreed with that diagnosis, saying the crisis ""has taken its toll on our exports.""

But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Severe losses can shock any investor out of inertia, often in destructive ways.Here is a list of constructive steps you can take instead:",1,0.3190000000000001,0.6809999999999999,3808

Pricier oil drives up the costs of everything from gas at the pump to the raw materials used to make nylon and food packaging. That could mean higher inflation and prompt consumers, who lately have shown more willingness to spend, to cut back their purchases.Oil prices have risen 7.35% since the beginning of the year, while gasoline futures have risen 10.67%.The question now is whether turmoil in the Middle East and Northern Africa could lead to a sustained cutback in production or delivery disruptions that could drive those prices much higher and push the U.S. as well as other countries back into recession.

Really? Well, yeah.OK, not for the half-naked demonstrators, the ranting anti-Semites, Kanye West or anyone else who has helped make Occupy Wall Street a target for easy ridicule.

That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P. Morgan didn't take on excessive mortgage risk and didn't need (although it was forced to take) TARP money.

But others said the increase will be followed by smaller price rises in coming months.The August increase, which equaled 5.5% at a compounded annual rate, followed a July rise of 0.3%, or 3.5% at a compounded annual rate, the Labor Department reported Friday. The August rise was the largest since a 0.5% increase in April.Fruit and vegetable prices, which surged 3.3% last month, accounted for much of the overall price increase.

Demand for manufactured goods fell sharply in August as new- home sales slid to their lowest monthly level in 17 years. And in the week ended Sept. 20, new unemployment filings hit the highest level since just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.U.S. leaders hope the government's massive interventions, plus plans for a big bailout now being negotiated, will soften the blow.

1633,"Behind the Middle-Class Funk. President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable livesConcern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did.",1,0.3694,0.6306,4011
1634,"Has the Bull Just Been Sleeping?. Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end.

BB&T is to exchange one share of BB&T for each share of Equitable. That values Equitable at $36.18 a share, a 34 percent premium over its most recent trading price before the deal was announced. Shares of Equitable rose more than $7 Friday to close at $34.47 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

1637,"Bond Rally Begun Tuesday Fizzles Out Despite Drop in Some Short-Term Rates. NEW YORK -- A bond market rally that began Tuesday fizzled out yesterday afternoon despite a decline in some closely watched short-term interest rates.Prices of some actively traded U.S. government bonds rose early in the morning but later faded, winding up the session little changed from Wednesday's closing levels. That performance was in sharp contrast to the stock market, where prices surged in record volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 13 points to close at 1282.24.Many economists continue to forecast slightly lower interest rates over the next few months because they expect slower economic growth. But numerous investment managers remain leery about long-term bonds, partly because of concern that recent government reports understate the economy's strength. For example, they worry that strong spending by consumers will continue, adding fuel to the economy's expansion and leading to increases in business borrowing.Several major department-store chains yesterday reported large increases in their December sales. In addition, auto makers announced sales gains for late December. Further signs of the economy's health will appear today when the Labor Department announces unemployment statistics for December. Many analysts yesterday said they expect the civilian unemployment rate to be little changed from November's 8.4% level.""The unemployment picture continues to show modest improvement,"" according to a Bankers Trust Co. report. ""We anticipate that the unemployment rate drifted down to 8.3% of the civilian labor force in December,"" said the bank's Key Indicator Forecasts.

1639,"Fed Considers More Action Amid New Recovery Doubts. Disappointing U.S. economic data, new strains in financial markets and deepening worries about Europe's fiscal crisis have prompted a shift at the Federal Reserve, putting back on the table the possibility of action to spur the recovery.Such action seemed highly unlikely at the central bank's April meeting, when forecasts for growth and employment were brightening. At their policy meeting this month, Fed officials will weigh whether the U.S. economic outlook is deteriorating enough to justify new measures to boost growth, according to interviews and Fed speeches.The Fed's next meeting, June 19 and 20, could be too soon for conclusive decisions. Fed policy makers have many unanswered questions and have had trouble forming consensus in the past. Top Fed officials have said that they would support new measures if they became convinced the U.S. wasn't making progress on bringing down unemployment. Recent disappointing employment reports have raised this possibility, but the data might be a temporary blip. Moreover, the Fed's options for more easing are sure to stir internal resistance at the central bank if they are considered.Their options include doing nothing and continuing to assess the economic outlook--or more strongly signaling a willingness to act later if the outlook more clearly worsens. Fed policy makers could take a small precautionary measure, like extending for a short period its ""Operation Twist"" program, in which the Fed is selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities. Or, policy makers could take bolder action such as launching another large round of bond purchases if they become convinced of a significant slowdown.The landscape for the Fed is complicated by the presidential election. Mindful of his own legacy and the Fed's independence, Chairman Ben Bernanke seems unlikely to allow the political calendar to sway his decisions. He appears especially immune from politics now, with just 18 months left in his term as chairman and little indication that he wants another. Still, some investors speculate the Fed has an incentive to decide quickly to avoid shifting policies close to the November vote.",1,0.0,1.0,4051

Plus, there are clear risks that the Fed's action will create economic and market distortions.Yet those received little acknowledgment in the Fed's statement. The central bank's justification for the move is that unemployment, at 9.7%, remains too high, that core inflation is too low, and that lackluster gross domestic product growth is unlikely to change that soon.Also, having encouraged markets to factor in another bout of monetary experimentation, the Fed probably did not feel it had the option to disappoint.

1643,"Help (Very Much) Wanted. Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France.",1,0.0,1.0,4094

But President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are finding that the old maxim that what goes around, comes around applies to them, too. Less than six months into his term, Mr. Obama's top initiatives -- health-care reform and ""cap and trade"" energy legislation -- are in serious jeopardy and he has himself and his congressional allies to blame.Their high-pressure tactics in promoting and passing legislation, most notably the economic ""stimulus"" enacted in February, have backfired. Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933. Like FDR, Mr. Obama tried to push as many liberal bills through Congress in as brief a time as possible.He made a rookie mistake early on. He let congressional Democrats draft the bills. They're as partisan as any group that has ever controlled Congress, and as impatient. They have little interest in the compromises needed to attract Republican support. As a consequence, what they passed -- especially the $787 billion stimulus -- belongs to Democrats alone. They own the stimulus outright.That makes them accountable for the hopes of a prompt economic recovery now being dashed. With the economy still faltering and jobs still being lost, Mr. Obama's credibility is sinking and his job approval rating is declining along with the popularity of his initiatives.

1647,"The Case for A Recession. Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually.",1,0.371,0.629,4115

Alan Murray's Dec. 3 column ""Political Calculus: Bush Now Embraces a Stimulus Package"" suggests that the administration's economic-stimulus plan is largely politically motivated and would have only a moderate short-term economic impact. Isn't it a little early to start criticizing a plan that is still being developed?Though we are encouraged by some recent signs of a rebound, the economy is recovering at half the rate of past recessions. A carefully crafted consumer, investor and business tax package would provide the synergies needed to push the economy into high gear and help ensure durable economic growth. In a recent letter to the president, we suggested cutting consumer taxes, allowing larger depreciation write-offs and reducing the double taxation of dividends.Our studies show that allowing companies to deduct 50% of corporate dividends would add one-half a percentage point to average GDP growth through 2005. Similarly, our study shows that this change would accelerate productivity growth to 2.4% over the next three years, compared with 2% without this change. A phased reduction of the double tax on corporate dividends would encourage firms to rely more on equity financing, leading to higher investment spending and a larger capital stock.One of the most effective ways to spur business investment and continued technological advances that promote productivity growth is through an enhanced capital-cost recovery system. Finally, accelerating the tax cuts enacted in June 2001 will help ensure that consumer confidence and spending remain strong. Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual rate, they also will benefit from accelerated rate cuts.Jerry Jasinowski",1,0.31299999999999994,0.687,4161

1658,"The Elder Share. ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs.

Furthermore, the 2007 audit found six ""reportable conditions"" -- one step removed from a material weakness.Among the reportable conditions were problems with the city's handling of federal grant money, its payment of unemployment and disability compensation, its system for approving overtime pay and the financial management of two now-defunct planning agencies.",1,0.33330000000000004,0.6667,4190

The Philadelphia Fed also uncovered evidence that factory wages are rising as a result of worker shortages.And a separate Fed report said the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.9% of capacity in May, higher than at any time since March 1980. Economists say that the closer business gets to operating at full capacity, the greater the risks of a spurt in inflation.Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.5% in April, largely reflecting a jump in wholesalers' inventories. Sales by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers dropped 0.2%. As a result, the ratio of inventories-to-sales increased slightly to 1.51 in April from 1.50 in March, remaining within the range in which the ratio has traveled for the past year.As the factory problems noted by the Fed may be interpreted by some as a sign of an overheating economy and more inflation, they could lead the central bank to boost interest rates in the coming months.

He also would raise taxes on gasoline, beer, wine, cigarettes and industrial pollutants, and would cut military spending by 3% from current levels. The goal of his five-year, $511.6 billion plan is to eliminate the projected budget deficit by the end of fiscal 1994 and create surpluses each year thereafter.But the Rostenkowski plan, or even anything close to it, isn't likely to be enacted this year as long as President Bush opposes major tax increases and cuts in Social Security.

Roth, senior vice president at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. ""Nobody is willing to make a substantive commitment until we see something definitive coming out of Washington on the budget.""The seemingly never-ending budget talks failed to produce an agreement yesterday. However, White House and congressional negotiators have said they are optimistic about reaching a compromise accord of roughly $30 billion before Friday, when across-the-board cuts are scheduled to go into effect under the Gramm-Rudman law.""If we don't get a deficit reduction of $30 billion or more, it's not going to sit well with investors,"" contended Donald E.

NEW YORK -- Small was beautiful in August as microcap stock funds picked up steam and posted the best returns among domestic equity funds.However, investors may not want to build their hopes too high for microcap funds, which typically invest in companies with market capitalizations of less than $300 million. Observers say the sector's gains weren't so much the result of increased buying of microcap stocks, but rather a lack of selling as the rest of the stock market headed lower.According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., microcap funds provided investors with a 5.54% return in August. And while that was the smallest monthly gain for the group since April, it topped all other categories of equity funds during August. The closest sector was small-cap funds, which posted a 1.83% gain for the month.Funds that had been the big winners all year -- funds tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- were the big losers among domestic stock funds in August, dropping 5.59%.Over the past 13 weeks, microcap stocks are well ahead of all other domestic equity funds, with a nearly 19% gain since June 6.

1685,"B8 Sunday, Skptkmhkr 29, 1983. The pending farm bill provides no parity for the poor. Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. ItUas asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isnUat surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.They arenUat all wrong. Food prices went up 4 percent last year, and this yearUas increase is expected to be about the same. Our food prices are generally lower than those in other countries. I believe urban America has a stake in maintaining a healthy farm economy.",1,0.3769,0.6231,4328

The central bank on Wednesday cut its key interest rate to a 45-year low of 1% from 1.25% and suggested it will keep the rate low as long as necessary to ensure an economic recovery. The Fed's assertion that the labor market was stabilizing surprised some observers, but it may have been influenced by the latest jobless claims data.During the past 2 1/2 years, the U.S. economy has lost more than three million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has climbed to a nine-year high of 6.1%.

Economists regard any number above 400,000 as suggestive of a deteriorating jobs market.But for the past three weeks, the volume of initial claims has declined consistently, and economic forecasters say they expect job losses to end soon.

Interest rates, which are near an all-time low, have been steadily dropping, and consumers have taken advantage of these lower rates.There are some costs, though, just as there were when you obtained your original mortgage. The only differences between a purchase and a refinance are that there is no buyer or seller present at closing, and no real estate broker is involved.Your refinance lender, even if it is the same lender who holds your current loan, has to start from scratch. The lender must obtain current financial information about you, contract for an updated appraisal of the property and receive an updated title report.

By 39% to 23%, voters expect things to get better over the next year -- the highest level in a year.""It's the second month in a row that there's been an uptick in the perception that things are getting better, and that's often a precursor of economic recovery,"" say pollsters Peter Hart and Vince Breglio, who conducted the survey.

President Obama, in speech after speech, proudly makes the following point: Although we inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, we have generated net new jobs every month, and while we need to do more, we are going in the right direction.Of course, recoveries always go in the right direction--that is, things get better over time. But merely going in the right direction is an incredibly low performance standard. Moreover, since deep recessions are generally followed by more robust recoveries, this should have been one of the strongest recoveries ever.So what went wrong? All the available Keynesian levers for achieving economic growth have been pulled, yet the recovery is one of the weakest since World War II. The problem lies with the way the ""stimulus"" was carried out, the uncertainty of looming higher taxes, and the antibusiness rhetoric and regulatory strong-arming of this administration.First, exactly how weak has this recovery been? The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis tracks economic performance for each recovery and compares gross-domestic-product growth and job growth, the two most important indicators of economic performance. Over the past 60 years, there have been 11 recessions and 11 recoveries.Sadly, this recovery is near the bottom of all 11. Cumulative nonfarm job growth is just 1.9% 34 months into recovery, the ninth-worst performance and well below the average job growth of 6.5%.

1752,"U.S. Industrial Output Jumped 0.9% In April Despite Higher Interest Rates. WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. factories, mines and utilities continued to accelerate in April, offering further evidence of the economy's strength in the face of rising interest rates.Industrial output jumped 0.9% last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1% higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7%, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3% increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly.With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4% to 82.1%, the first time that the index has climbed above 82% in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84%, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecksThe report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years.Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6% run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7% in April, and is up an eye-popping 59% year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6% after being flat the last two months.",1,0.0,1.0,4747

Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.Consumer spending is ""strengthening sharply in the first quarter"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is ""recovering after the post-hurricane lull"" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements.

""We're at war.""The president has used a similar technique on the stump, when explaining his decision to go to war in Iraq in light of the subsequent failure to find stockpiles of forbidden weapons.

1783,"U.S. News: Producer Prices Log Another Monthly Drop, Showing the Weakness in Global Demand. U.S. wholesale prices sank further last month, a sign of how quickly the inflationary pressures of last summer have reversed.Producer prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in December from the previous month, the Labor Department said, led by lower energy prices. It marks the fifth-straight monthly decline and a stunning reversal in just a few short months from the price pressures seen in mid-2008.The lower prices bring some much-needed relief to hard-pressed businesses as the U.S. recession marches on -- but they also reflect weakness in global demand for goods. Manufacturing activity is down sharply in the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., Japan and Europe; it also has slowed in markets like China that once had enormous demand for raw materials. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5%. The declines are expected to be passed on to consumers, as businesses work to attract customers through heavy discounting. The Labor Department will release its December consumer prices on Friday.Excluding food and energy, core producer prices held up last month, rising 0.2% from November and 4.3% from the previous year -- the largest annual gain in two decades. But core prices are expected to decline in the months ahead, which, combined with falling wages, is stoking concerns about a looming downward spiral of lower prices and spending known as deflation.",1,0.0,1.0,4950

The Washington metropolitan area's economy stumbled slightly in February, but promises to turn in a positive performance for the first quarter and the rest of the year, according to the Greater Washington Research Center.The Research Center said that indicators that measure the economy's current health weakened in February, in part because of poor weather but also because ""the economy is not strong enough to keep driving ahead at an increasing rate,"" according to Steve Fuller, an urban affairs specialist for George Washington University who tracks the local economy for the center.Fuller added, however, that the center's leading indicators, which forecast growth approximately six months into the future, were all stronger in February than a month before. It was the first time in 11 months that all the leading indicators were positive, he said.Despite weakness in February and continuing bad weather into the spring, the Washington area economy appears to have turned in a positive performance for the first three months of the year, according to Fuller. Early data indicate that installation of basic business telephone service was up 37 percent from a year earlier, with most of the growth in Northern Virginia. Housing sales were up slightly, despite worse weather this year than last, Fuller said, and employment more than doubled in the first three months of 1993 over a year earlier. Unemployment in March was 4.4 percent, compared with 5.3 percent a year earlier, he noted.Fuller said that data on employment appears to suggest that jobs are being created in start-up enterprises or by area residents becoming self-employed.",1,0.3357,0.6643,4955

In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%.

The lurching stock market may make consumers queasy, but it's going to take more than that to make them sick enough to trigger an economic downturn.Think back to 1987. Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, ""only at some future point"" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R. French, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. Still, a continued stock price plunge in that sector, he said, might reduce its access to venture capital and inhibit initial public offerings.In general, however, the wider economy is largely insulated from the stock market's volatility.
