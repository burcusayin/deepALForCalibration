      " Author Takes New Path In Quest for Excellence; Tom Peters Now Calls U.S. Situation Dire. After five years of preaching the gospel of corporate excellence in blockbuster bestsellers such as \"In Search of Excellence\" and \"A Passion for Excellence,\" Peters is taking it all back-or at least most of it.Forget the whole theory of excellence, and the eight basic principles to stay on top of the heap. \"There are no excellent companies,\" said Peters, raising the curtain on his new book, \"Thriving on Chaos: Handbook for a Management Revolution,\" which hits the bookstores tomorrow.Even his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, felt it had to prepare readers-or \"fans\"-for the incongruity of it all. \"This message may seem ludicrous to those who know Tom Peters as the co-author of `In Search of Excellence' and `A Passion for Excellence,' the two most successful management books in publishing history,\" warned the Knopf promotion department.The message of the book may not be ludicrous, but it will take a leap of faith for those who grew addicted to the old, optimistic, upbeat Tom Peters who believed treating employes well, fostering innovation and putting the customer first were the secrets of \"excellent\" companies.\"There is good news from America,\" he and co-author Robert Waterman Jr. told readers of \"In Search of Excellence.\" \"Good management practice today is not resident only in Japan. But more important, the good news comes from treating people decently and asking them to shine, and from producing things that work.\"\n",

      " Where Money Is Tight, Fourth of July May Fizzle; In Pa., a Door-to-Door Fight for Fireworks. She has never felt confident with big numbers, so Kip Fordney brings along a college math major to count the money sure to pile up. Fordney, the head of Shippensburg's parks and recreation department, walks through downtown carrying a one-pound deli container turned into a collection cup and stops at each storefront to deliver a rehearsed pitch. \"We're trying to save the Fourth of July fireworks,\" she says, over and over. \"Can you help?\"After each stop, Fordney, 49, hands the donations to her assistant, who thumbs through the checks and bills before offering a running total.No matter how many times they recount, the numbers don't add up. Fireworks, held in Memorial Park every summer since the 1940s, would cost $5,300; a dwindling budget and lackluster donations have left Fordney responsible for raising every cent. If she fails to secure the money in the next few days, the town of 5,600 people in south-central Pennsylvania will forgo fireworks and cancel the disc jockey on its self-proclaimed \"Best Day of Summer.\" The residents who gather annually at the high school football field to lie on blankets, listen to \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and drink free Wild Cherry Pepsi and Mountain Dew will instead be left to contemplate a dark sky, in yet the latest reminder of the economic crisis.More than 40 communities across the country have already canceled their Fourth of July fireworks, conceding to a new reality: Shooting off a colorful array of explosives, an American birthright since 1777, is now a luxury that borders on wasteful. Unlike in Washington, where tens of thousands will fight for position on the Mall, these are places that represent what Independence Day means in most of America -- a hillside covered with friends and neighbors, a few dozen fireworks set off by the volunteers from the fire department, a sweet, small-town sense of community on a warm summer night.And yet the mayor in Lowell, Mass., laid off 48 employees and canceled fireworks earlier this month, reasoning that it saved employee No. 49. Some towns near Washington, from Herndon to Laurel, said sluggish fundraising could force them to scale back. Chesapeake Beach, Md., will shoot off fireworks on July 3 because it procured a discounted rate; organizers in Charlottesville warned that next year, fireworks might be canceled entirely.\n",

      " Interpreting Christian Words. In \"Who Speaks for God?\" {op-ed, July 19}, Peter M. Storm presents a tangle of arguments in defense of the \"Christian left\" (a label hurled as a dart by Pat Buchanan, but embraced as a badge by Mr. Storm - shame on both). It would be a lengthy process to untangle the entire yarn, but some points warrant explicit response.(1) Mr. Storm writes about \"the Christian right's campaign to impose its agenda on all Americans.\" The notion of \"imposing an agenda\" is a curious concept in an arena where citizens or their elected representatives are voting on the issues at hand. Especially since we have the Bill of Rights, I for one am much more comfortable with the right's choice of the democratic process as the field of battle than with the left's choice of the courts to accomplish what it could not do through winning over the minds of the populace.(2) \"{O}ne can reasonably ask how a movement that wants the government to decide which books may be in a library ... can also promote itself as in favor of `nonintrusive government.' \" It is government entities, be they federal, state or local, that provide most libraries and schools and are called on to aid U.S. citizens abroad etc. Where else should concerned citizens go to register complaints? (3) \"{R}eligion should inform and prescribe our personal lives, but not our politics.\" In this statement, Mr. Storm torpedoes the foundation of American government, which is: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" I'm glad Mr. Storm was not around in the last century to send the abolitionists staggering home, rebuked by the force of his argument.(4) \"{W}ere Jesus alive ...\" Mr. Storm writes. Jesus is alive; surely Mr. Storm must have picked up that much from the book he claims to \"read and love.\" This is a substantive, not semantic, point that deserves its own article.(5) \"I suspect that God does not care very much about the tax code... . I even suspect that God has a greater agenda than one that would leave room for concerns about the size of the annual U.S., Swedish or Italian budget deficit.\" This is as grievous an error in logic as his worry that the Christian right finds divine tax codes in the Bible. The \"omnipotence\" of the God Mr. Storm believes in precludes the notion that any of these human concerns escapes His attention. The point missed by both \"Christian right\" and \"Christian left\" is the division of labor God has laid down. The charge to work for the health and welfare of our fellow humans comes from on high. Establishing the relative roles of public- and private-sector entities in carrying out this charge is for us as free-willed souls to determine in reasoned and courteous debate.\n",

Those who are with her and those who are against her agree that Deborah \"Arnie\" Arnesen, the first woman ever nominated to be New Hampshire's governor, is a dynamite candidate.She is an exclamation point of a person, thin, intense, direct, funny. She isn't turned out like your typical questing female pol. Her nails are bitten to the quick, her suits are practical, her shoes are flat. She's brainy, and she knows New Hampshire's pocketbook like her own. She can talk to Republicans and Rotarians in a way nobody would have imagined, especially for a mouthy woman born in Brooklyn and brash as they come, an abortion rights liberal, an ACLU member and an in-your-face feminist who defiantly nursed her younger daughter in the chamber of the state legislature, where she has served since 1984.Despite a temperament and philosophy that might put off voters in the country's most conservative state, she had a big victory in last Tuesday's primary. She got 40,000 votes, more than the combined totals of her two popular rivals. She expected it. \"I have been at this for a year and 57 days,\" she said as she hung out before the Carpenter Center polling place in Manchester on Election Day.She stuck her head in car windows, making her last-minute pitch. She said she expects to win in November.Over a quick snack in a nearby restaurant, she unfurls the speech about New Hampshire that has mesmerized audiences in halls all over the state. She talks about the decline and fall of the economy as if it were a morality play.

      " Bookshelf: Toward a 'Warrior Age'. Ravi Batra's best-selling \"The Great Depression of 1990\" (Simon & Schuster, 235 pages, $17.95) predicts \"the worst economic turmoil in history . . . more cataclysmic than any mankind has yet seen.\" It gains credibility from a foreword by Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who calls it \"novel and brilliant.\" Mr. Batra has already made the cover of Financial World.\"I am no astrologer, no psychic,\" the author assures us, \"not a sensationalist or a Jeremiah.\" But that doesn't exhaust the possibilities. Mr. Batra is proud of his \"obsession\" with the teachings of Prabhat Ranja Sarkar, described as an expert in many disciplines, \"above all, spirituality.\" The disciple discovered that \"here at last was a philosophy of history that in one stroke could unravel the mystery of every social phenomenon.\" Like Marx, Mr. Batra's guru preaches historical determinism and class conflict, but adds warriors and intellectuals to the usual classes of exploited laborers and greedy acquisitors (capitalists).\"The acquisitors grow richer and richer at the expense of other classes,\" the author explains. Fortunately, this \"will force a crisis that will ultimately give way to sanity in politics, the economy, and the general state of affairs.\"\"Eventually, things become so wretched that angry warriors and intellectuals rise in rebellion and with the help of laborers bring an end to the age of acquisitors. . . . Society will then move into another warrior age.\"What will this new \"sanity\" look like? \"In the warrior age the army, headed by a dictator . . . controls the government as well as society. Political authority is centralized in the form of an absolute government, people are highly disciplined, family ties are morally binding, women are well respected, and so on.\"\n",

      " Middle Managers in the Class War. Politicians who complain about \"corporate bosses\" gaining at the expense of \"American workers\" are often accused of engaging in class warfare, which clashes with America's proud self-image as a classless society. But soaring executive compensation amid stagnant pay for average workers, the continuing hangover from a wave of corporate scandals and other realities keep this us-and-them issue very much alive. Indeed, Sen. John Edwards's \"Two Americas\" stump speech is but a polite and politic way of introducing social class and economic power into public discussion.But the bipolar view of class and economic interests that shapes this traditional Two Americas view reflects an outdated understanding of the American workplace. For decades, when academics, politicians and others spoke of \"workers,\" they generally meant people who used their hands and backs to produce things. The growth of hotel, restaurant, health care, Wal-Mart and other service sector jobs has not changed this: Real physical work is at the core of what it meant to be a \"worker.\" CEOs and other executives, meanwhile, remain atop the economic ladder.But I've conducted interviews over the past year with members of a significant and growing segment of American employees who are in the middle of this us-and-them perception. These are middle managers in large corporations, such as loan officers leading a team of lenders, office managers responsible for administrative infrastructure, engineers in charge of teams of software developers, managers of local bank branches, human resources supervisors and many more who form a major, if underrecognized, population: About 7 million employees are now classified as managers, while 11 million employees are production workers.These people are not paper pushers who simply clog up a useless bureaucracy. They are people with real skills who care about and enjoy their work and who can make useful things happen. Their skills are concrete, take time to learn and are to some extent portable to other companies. In short, these millions of middle managers are a new kind of craft worker, much like skilled electricians, carpenters and plumbers.They are certainly no longer the Organization Man (or Woman) of the 1950s and beyond, who, while conformist and restricted in what they could do, at least tended to have job security. Many of today's middle managers have more opportunity to be creative entrepreneurs within their companies, but, like other workers, they now also tend to have, at best, modest job security. Waves of corporate restructuring have left them vulnerable to layoffs and outsourcing. Also, like other workers, many of these middle managers feel their \"bosses\" are making poor decisions beyond their control and even their understanding. But unlike traditional workers, who use unions or ties to political parties to make their case and press for relief, these middle managers tend to be apolitical and have little sense of alternatives to their insecure world and how politics might reduce their insecurity.\n",

      " Cotton and Inflation. The price of cotton has tripled over the past year, and the textile industryUas shrieks of anguish and despair grow steadily more audible. The sudden, shocking leap in cotton prices is owed partly to the Agriculture DepartmentUas misguided decision last winter to reduce acreage allotments to keep prices from falling. It is also partly owed to a massive and unprecedented flow of exports that, it turns out, the Treasury Department is subsidizing. The case of cotton sharply illustrates the obsolete policies and official evasions that are grievously aggravating J;he inflation in farm products.The price of cotton was 27 cents a pound a year ago. It had sunk a bit over the course of the summer, and the Agriculture Department decided to cut this yearUas acreage. Perhaps the department was also trying to save a little money. It had promised the White House to cut down the farm subsidy outlays, as its contribution to reducing Mr. MixonUas budget deficit. In any event, the acreage planted in cotton last spring was well below the 1972 level.Then the export boom got under way, led by tremendous purchases from Japan. In early September, Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) called on the administration to impose export controls on cotton. In response, that invaluable organization,' Tax Analysts and Advocates, pointed out that the Treasury Department is actually subsidizing the cotton exports under a provision that, in the very different circumstances of previous years. Senator Talmadge himself had forced upon it. The subsidy operates through a device known as the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) which, to put it briefly, is a tax dodge intended to induce manufacturers not to move their factories abroad. Applying DISC to agriculture is, of course, ludicrous. When did you last hear of a runaway cotton field being shipped to Taiwan?The farmers who sell cotton are not, at the moment, complaining. But it is another matter for the manufacturers who buy it. The textile industryUas trade association bitterly denounces the shortages and warns that UIthe enormous raw material cost increases, unless moderated, inevitably will result in hundreds of millions of dollars of price increases to consumers.U The latest Wholesale Price Index, published a few days ago, shows that from August to September the prices of cotton textiles andThe sudden export boom is related to the turmoil in the worldUas monetary system which, as the Wholesale Price Index suggests, has a certain relevance to the way things are going here at home. In the days when the United States kept the value of the dollar artificially high and Japan kept the yen artificially low, a huge amounUof dollars accumulated in Tokyo banks. By the time the dollar was devalued in late 1971, JapanUas dollar reserves were larger than the U.S. governmentUas. The then Secretary of the Treasury, John Connally, declared that those reserves could not be converted into gold and, in his customary engaging manner, told the rest of the world that they could like it or lump it. Tile Japanese, it develops, did neither. Like most other holders of dollars abroad, they began converting their dollars into such commodities as cotton. The world is now off the gold standard and on what you might call the cotton-soybean-copper standard. If we could design a mechanism to protect the commodities against sudden speculative swoops and pounces, it would be quite a good system.\n",

      " REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Tower of Babble. Bill Clinton did his best to look attentive at his economic summit yesterday, but to really understand what was going on the President-elect would have needed earphones with instant translation. How else could he, or anyone else, make sense of this economic tower of babble?That may seem harsh, but is there a theme we're missing here other than that the country's a mess and Mr. Clinton plans to do something about it? Opening the two-day conference, Mr. Clinton dusted off his campaign stump speech, which may have been only prudent since no conclave of 300 people is ever going to be more than a giant bull session. Some in the Clinton camp have thought this was a dumb idea from the start, which is at least reassuring. Their least-awful solution has been to make the event a kind of economic \"Oprah,\" in which designees from all sides of the Clinton coalition get to explain how they feel about the economy.So we have economist Allen Sinai, who supports a cut in the capital gains tax, communing with MIT Keynesian Robert Solow, who wants to raise virtually every tax known to man. David Osborne, the \"reinventing government\" author, gets to schmooze with Ken Geiger of the teachers' unions, which think public schools with 50% drop-out rates deserve more money. Perhaps they'll all have a mind meld.Assorted small-business owners (such as the trendy folk at neo-prep clothier J. Crew), who are supposed to create all sorts of \"high-wage jobs,\" get to mingle with Jessica Tuchman Mathews, who would saddle those same owners with new environmental rules that cost jobs. Our favorite name on the summit list, we have to admit, is Chief Wilma Mankiller, representing the \"Cherokee Nation,\" though we hope not a feminist economic priority.Our own view, since Mr. Clinton is asking, is that the U.S. is not in fact in any economic crisis. The economy is now expanding, more slowly than we'd like, but enough so that any \"short-term\" stimulus would be counterproductive. If there is an economic emergency now, it's in Japan and Germany, which are both in recession and have long-term structural problems. Far from beating our brains out, Japan in particular might soon be asking the Clinton administration for financial help.\n",

      " Book Report. RICHARD KLEIN remembers his first puff only vaguely: he was 12, and sneaked around the corner at school with some friends. His last is equally indistinct: It was a couple of years ago in a bar in Paris. He smoked about half of the single cigarette he had been carrying around, and decided not to finish the rest. The decades in between were filled with packs of Marlboros and Gitanes, too many to count. \"You never smoke just one cigarette,\" says the 53-year-old professor of French at Cornell. \"It's always connected to the one that came before and the one that will come after.\"The decisive moment for Klein came in his mid-thirties, as he watched his body start to decline. \"I was making efforts to exercise, and discovered the effects smoking had on that. I realized I had to do something about this habit, and for the next 10 years began to struggle manfully.\" He also began to read Kant, in particular The Critique of Judgment and his theories about the sublime.The addiction, the struggle against it and the philosopher came together to produce Cigarettes Are Sublime, an elegant and erudite examination of the question: If cigarettes are so bad, why do so many people insist on smoking them? \"There is nowhere in the world,\" the author notes, \"where people do not smoke if they are allowed to do so.\"A cigarette offers what Kant terms a \"negative pleasure\": an intimation of infinity, a safe glimpse into the void. \"Warning smokers or neophytes of the dangers entices them more powerfully to the edge of the abyss, where, like travelers in a Swiss landscape, they can be thrilled by the subtle grandeur of the perspectives on mortality opened by the little terrors in every puff,\" Klein writes. \"Cigarettes are bad. That is why they are good - not good, not beautiful, but sublime.\"Quoting the book out of context - cigarettes, according to one passage, are \"one of America's proudest contributions to the world\" - can make it seem like Klein is secretly employed by the tobacco companies. Actually, he makes clear upfront that he's stopped smoking, is glad of it, and isn't trying to encourage anyone else. After all, his whole point is that smokers don't need much encouragement.\n",

      " A 2 2 MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1978  . THE UNITED STATESUa allies in Europe and Japan are getting worried about the American inability UOor is it unwillingness?UOto curb oil imports. The best reasons for controlling oil consumption are, of course, to protect this countryUas own national security and economic stability. But the debate has been almost exclusively in terms of domestic interests. ThereUas another dimension to the issue that generally goes unmentioned in this country. ItUas the political effect in Western Europe and Japan of the spectacle of the American government lost in wandering, inconclusive debate over energy.The Carter energy bill is still hung up in that marathon congressional conference. The most effective section of the bill, the tax on crude oil, is not likely to be enacted at all. This deadlock in Congress has acquired great symbolic significance abroad. There it is taken as an indication of American refusal to deal seriously with a subject of urgent common concern.The American failure to restrain oil imports has had harsher consequences abroad, so far, than here. Other industrial countries, more dependent on OPECUas oil than the United States, fear that unrestrained American demand will hasten the crisis that President Carter has predicted and strengthen the forces within OPEC that want sharply higher prices. The large American trade deficits, caused mainly by oil imports, weaken the dollar abroad. The impacts on other countriesUa domestic economies are severe, ranging from bankruptcies in Japan to unemployment in Germany. If other governments become persuaded that the United States is no longer going to respond to acknowledged economic threats like excessive oil imports, they are going to try to protect themselves in ways damaging to everyone. That meansNext month President Carter will meet in Bonn with his counterparts from six other big industrial countries to attempt to draft a joint economic program. The United States wants its partners to do a number of things that they say will be difficult and painful. They, in turn, want the United States to do two things: to show that it takes inflation seriously, and to demonstrate that it is not going to let its oil imports keep floating upward without limit. The Carter administrationUas present attention to inflation is probably as much as anyone expects it to be able to do for the present on that score. But on oil imports, it is going to have to come up with much more specific action if it is to be persuasive. Otherwise, Mr. Carter takes a severe risk that the whole summit conference will evaporate in generalities and evasions. The other governments are now fixed on the American performance on oil-import curbs as a test of intentions. If the United States does not meet that test, other governments are not likely to respond with much enthusiasm to the requests being made of them.What kind of curbs? Quotas on oil imports are not an inviting idea. The only other possibility would be import fees imposed by presidential order. The administration is profoundly reluctant to resort to import fees, for it still hopes to persuade Congress to pass the crude-oil tax this year. But that hope becomes thinner by the week. Certainly this country has stronger reasons to act rapidly on imports than merely to rescue an international meeting. But if the Bonn meeting in July is a washout, the fragmentation of purpose among the rich countries is only likely to increase.\n",

      " Big Steel, Bad Gridlock. Washingtonians headed south this month, beware. The long, hot season of traffic congestion around Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens is in full swing. This year's tie-up has an interesting twist. A new Busch Gardens exit, including a bridge over Interstate 64, was supposed to open this summer but the project is a full year behind schedule. The exit will benefit tourists and residents by redirecting traffic from clogged roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation explains that its contractor faces a severe shortage of U.S.-made steel for the project.Federal \"Buy American\" laws forbid interstate highway projects with federal financing from using imported steel, even if there is no domestic steel available. The restrictions apply equally to the raw material (rolled beam) or the fabricated product (finished girders). A Northern Virginia contractor with whom I spoke said his supplier could use imported rolled beam for the contractor's private projects, but for federal roads projects such as the Interstate 95 exchange at Springfield, the domestic raw material costing 15 to 30 percent more was required. By expensively micromanaging his projects, his firm has steel. Others are scrambling. Guess who ultimately pays the extra cost.Buy American policies are nothing new, and they have a patriotic plausibility to most people. Who could be against saving American jobs? In many circumstances they are also innocuous. On the other hand, if they squeeze out imports as intended, they maintain higher prices to American steel users or cause them production delays waiting for backlogged orders to clear. This may save some jobs in favored industries like steel, but at a cost of sales and jobs in American industries that use steel. The benefits this policy provides to the protected steel workers and shareholders come directly out of the pockets of other Americans. This is income redistribution of the worst sort--from average folks to a group that earns substantially more than the manufacturing mean wage. In times of high unemployment, Buy American provisions conceivably can raise domestic demand, thus cushioning a cyclical downturn. But these discriminatory policies are hopelessly inefficient compared with Alan Greenspan's well-oiled monetary policy machine. By the way, has anyone checked the unemployment rate lately?What many people do not realize is that the most intense competition American firms face is not with foreign firms but with other American firms in markets for talented labor and scarce capital. Any policy that favors one set of American industries disfavors others. The most important possible exception to this is for policies that are designed to enhance innovation in ways that spill over to other American firms. Buy American policies are not directed toward research and development, and the steel industry is not at the cutting edge of technical progress.Highway construction contractors happily use Komatsu earth-moving equipment and a host of other imported products. So why is USX favored and Caterpillar not? The answer, of course, is lobbying power. A large industry spread across a number of important states often gets its way. Alas for the steel industry, its influence isn't what it used to be. The industry employs more than 400,000 fewer workers than it did in 1960. Small, modern mini-mills now provide almost half of domestic output. They have production costs substantially lower than the remaining large-scale integrated mills for which steel protectionism was designed.\n",

      " The `Strength to Love'. THE BIRTHDAY of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is a national holiday because he spoke to all Americans, by word and example, about what it meant to be an American. Dr. King's message, finally, was not about race but justice, not about power but love.Since Dr. King's death, the word love has not been much invoked in our political discourse, about race or anything else. It strikes the ear of 1993 as naive, a word that can't teach us much about either the causes or remedies of injustice. Politics is dominated by the language of power, social policy by numbers or ideology. Talk about race is accented by mistrust, anger and despair.Dr. King understood all this, but fought it throughout his life. A preacher of the Gospel, he understood that his task was not simply to organize his friends but to convert his enemies. \"The best way to assure oneself that love is disinterested,\" he said, \"is to have love for the enemy neighbor from whom you expect no good in return, but only hostility and persecution.\"In other hands, this might seem a recipe for resignation. On the contrary, Dr. King argued, only the strong could love. In his hands, love became a revolutionary concept that called into question the arrangements people accept on a day-to-day basis as \"normal.\" \"The hardhearted individual never sees people as people, but rather as mere objects or as impersonal cogs in an ever-turning wheel,\" he said in a sermon reprinted in his book \"The Strength to Love.\" \"In the vast wheel of industry, he sees men as hands. In the massive wheel of big city life, he sees men as digits in a multitude. In the deadly wheel of army life, he sees men as numbers in a regiment. He depersonalizes life.\"With love as a prism, Dr. King saw his way to a devastating critique of racial oppression in this country - but also to a solution. He demonized no one, lost hope in no one. His immediate cause was civil rights for African Americans, but his goal was an America that lived up to its promises - promises he revered. His was \"a dream deeply rooted in the American dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\"\n",

      " Strip Mining, Energy and Politics. The basic reason President Ford defied conventional political logic to cast his second veto of a bill to control strip-mining was summed up in private advice from Dr. Arthur Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.Burns, the nationUas independent central banker, is not a member of the administration. But his views are respected by Mr. Ford, and he often attends White House councils. He was present at one of the two sessions discussing the strip-mining bill and was asked his opinion. His pithy reply: UIMr. President, I donUat think we ought to be doing anything now to , increase the imports of oil.UIf Mr. Ford had lingering doubts, that probably resolved them. As Burns indicated, the veto was essentially an energy decision ruling out interference with coal production as an alternative to oil. That ahows how deeply the President has become committed to the energy question, giving replacement of oil by other energy sources priority over politically popular environmental questions. Thus, officials in the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) view the strip-mining veto as more Important than raising the oil import tax another dollar. In fact, they view it as the PresidentUas most important energy decision so far.Beyond energy, the veto suggests a toughened presidential style following , the Mayaguez incident. Mr. Ford was earning away from his congressional style of conciliation by vetoing the bill In the face of popular support, mixed Republican attitude* in Congress and deeply divided advice with-in his own administration.Divided though that advice was, there was no doubt among FEA officials, Contending that recently enact- ed state regulation prevents the environmental outrages of oldtime strip-mining, they shuddered over 8,000 new federal regulatory bureaucrats. More important, they considered vital a precedent of Mr. Ford's giving energy priority'over environment in a forthcoming series.-.of such choices.\n",

      " S&Ls: Much More Than Sleaze. It may have been the financial scandal of the century, yet the savings and loan crisis remains shrouded in mythology. Every S&L story features sleazy bankers and politicians. The scandal has become a giant caricature: a classic example (it is said) of how greed, corruption and inept regulation cost taxpayers between $500 billion and $1 trillion. Well, not exactly.In many ways, the popular perception is badly distorted. Ignored in its infancy, the scandal has been sensationalized in its maturity. Its costs, though huge, have been exaggerated, and its causes have been overdramatized. This makes good copy but bad history. There was more than sleaze to this. As the crisis fades into folklore, we need to pause and recall what actually happened and why. Let's start by puncturing some common myths.In fact, the big villain was inflation. Until the 1970s, S&Ls were a safe business. They took deposits at 3 or 4 percent and then lent the money as long-term home mortgages at 6 or 7 percent. Profits were almost guaranteed. Rising inflation destroyed this formula. Short- term deposit rates rose, leaving S&Ls with tens of billions of dollars in mortgages at lower rates. Losses exploded. By 1982, only 15 percent of S&Ls were profitable, and two-thirds were technically insolvent. Assets (mainly mortgages) were worth less than liabilities (mainly deposits).After that, there was plenty of inept management and bad government regulation. But everything flowed from the inflation. The Reagan administration and Congress gambled that the industry could be saved. S&Ls' lending powers were broadened to permit more lucrative loans on office buildings and other commercial construction projects. The gamble backfired. S&Ls - not experienced in these areas - made billions of dollars of lousy loans. A bad situation became worse.We can now see what happened. Because deposits were insured by the government, S&Ls could tap unlimited amounts of funds. They lured the funds with high interest rates. S&Ls then played with taxpayers' money. If new investments succeeded, the S&Ls would become profitable. If not, taxpayers would pick up the losses. Some S&Ls were taken over by high-fliers: the Charles Keatings of the world. But criminality was not the main problem; recklessness was. No one really knows how much outright fraud raised the bailout's cost. Estimates vary from 3 to 25 percent, according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office.\n",

Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man, than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery.\"Wrong uses Conrad's theme in her study of the calamitous three- decade reign of Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo -- which Mobutu renamed Zaire -- to say that \"no man is a caricature, no individual can alone bear responsibility for a nation's collapse.\" What happened in Zaire \"had its roots in a history of extraordinary outside interference, as basic in motivation as it was elevated in rhetoric.\" She is wholly unsentimental about Mobutu, whom she calls \"brutal, ruthless and greedy,\" a \"neighborhood thug,\" but she also insists that \"if Mobutu traced a Kurtz-like trajectory from high ideals to febrile corruption, he did not pursue that itinerary alone, or unaided.\"The story of Congo between Mobutu's rise to power in 1965 and his involuntary departure 32 years later is at once simple and familiar, yet unimaginably complicated, ambiguous and mysterious. On the one hand, it is a tale of a charming, stylish, intelligent, manipulative man who rose from unlikely origins, gained control of his government by unscrupulous means and bled its treasury dry; it is a tale that has been told many times, in many settings and with many casts of characters, and it gets no prettier with each retelling. On the other hand, it is a hugely intricate tapestry in which past and present are woven together in patterns that sometimes prove impenetrable; a tale involving so many people, organizations and acronyms that sheer bewilderment is the only honest way to respond; and a tale upon which it is impossible, in most respects if not all, to pronounce final and confident moral judgment.The legacy of Mobutu and his accomplices is stunning: \"Congo's economy has shrunk to the level of 1958, while the population has tripled. Average life expectancy is fifty-two, 80 per cent of the population is employed in 'subsistence activities'; illiteracy is growing; AIDS is rife and such diseases as bubonic plague and sleeping sickness are enjoying a vibrant comeback. By the end of the century the government's annual operating budget for what is potentially one of Africa's richest states was dipping below the daily takings of the US superstore Wal-Mart.\" There are many reasons, but it all comes down to this: Mobutu stole Congo blind.\n",

      " Fading Hope Rides the E-Mail; Ohio Man, One of 9 Million Americans Adrift, Lost Job, Home, Savings. \"Congratulations,\" the e-mail Adkins is reading starts off, and that first word alone is enough to flood him with an emotion he hasn't felt in nearly two years. Later, he will describe it. \"Jubilation,\" he will say. But for now, he reads what comes next -- \"on successfully advancing to Level 2 of the Trade Chief Assessment\" -- and sits, just sits, overcome.A 38-year-old single man, Adkins represents what in Washington is the political issue of what to do about the more than 9 million Americans who are either jobless or underemployed and an economy that has been described as \"slow\" and \"adrift.\" In Newark, Ohio, though, Adkins is simply one of the sadder stories around.Once a lawyer, he lost his job in June 2001 when his company downsized because of the worsening economy, and has seen his life collapse. He has exhausted his savings and retirement. He had to sell his house and the 40 acres he lived on and everything else he owned except a car, a bed, two chairs, a laptop computer and a TV. It took 18 months to find the part-time job he has now, which, to add to the sting, is at the local unemployment office helping people find jobs. He works in a cubicle that belongs to a woman on extended sick leave. The family pictures are hers. The decorations are hers. The bottle of water is his, and the day planner, and that's it. That's what two years have brought.But now comes word that, for the first time in hundreds of attempts, Adkins has made it to the second round for a job, a permanent, full-time position with the state, and after reading the e-mail, he goes to tell his supervisor, Patty Ernest, who is so happy for him that she comes around from her desk and gives him a hug.\"Poor Stuart,\" she says after he has returned to his cubicle. \"He's been through it, I'll tell you that much.\"\n",

      " Making Right Money Decisions. Whenever Nancy Lloyd comes face-to-face with consumers, they often ask the same question: \"How do I pay off my credit cards as quickly and inexpensively as possible?\" \"Most people get this wrong,\" says Lloyd, the local author of \"Simple Money Solutions: 10 Ways You Can Stop Feeling Overwhelmed by Money and Start Making It Work for You\" (Times Books, $23), \"but the rules keep changing, so I can't really blame them.\"Lloyd rarely blames consumers for their financial pitfalls and pratfalls.. The former Federal Reserve Board economist knows firsthand how easy making wrong money decisions can be, whether paying off credit cards, purchasing a new car or buying life insurance. That's why her new how-to book, which addresses those kinds of everyday and sometimes complex money issues, starts paying dividends from the first chapter on ending \"money yo-yo diets\" to the \"Time-Is-Money Calendar\" in the appendix.\"I always approach these problems as if I had to make the decision: What do I need to know and how do I do it?\" says Lloyd, who started tracking money issues 10 years ago in The Washington Post's Style Plus pages and since has been a contributing editor for Family Circle magazine, a money adviser for CBS News and ABC News, and National Public Radio commentator.Despite impressive credentials, Lloyd is no windbag. \"Simple Money Solutions\" proves to be exactly that--simple. \"A lot of the books try to show everybody how much they know about money and they use phenomenally big words,\" she says. \"I wanted to present it in a way you could just pick it up anywhere and follow the advice.\"Indeed, the book is driven by mistakes Lloyd or people she knows unwittingly made. \"In a lot of these financial issues,\" she says, \"people don't know what questions to ask until after something's gone wrong.\"\n",

      " Fed Looked to Rate Flexibility At Its Meeting Six Weeks Ago. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's top policy makers reached a consensus as far back as six weeks ago that they needed to amend their commitment to keep interest rates low for a \"considerable period\" and replace it with more-conditional language, central-bank documents released yesterday show.The documents, minutes of a Dec. 9 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, show that \"all of the members saw merit\" in replacing the language with words associated \"more clearly with economic conditions . . . as opposed to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.\" But the FOMC opted at the time to retain the phrase because a majority of its members preferred to keep it \"at least for now.\"The FOMC finally dropped the controversial phrase this week, replacing it with a more-vague assurance that it \"can be patient\" about raising interest rates as the economic recovery gains steam. The decision surprised Wall Street, causing stock prices to sink and bond yields to surge. Investors promptly advanced their expectations of just how soon the Fed will adjust interest rates, betting the increases will begin by June.The December minutes, however, cast doubt on Wall Street's interpretation of the Fed's intentions. At their meeting last month, Fed policy makers said it would be unwise for them to begin raising interest rates in advance of clear signs that inflation was shooting up. The Fed has historically sought to be \"pre-emptive\" about fighting inflation because inflation becomes harder to control at higher rates.But that posture could be risky in a climate of virtual price stability, the policy makers said. The Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates \"should the apparently vigorous expansion continue over time and promote fuller utilization of resources\" such as labor, they said, according to the minutes.\n",

      " Declining Energy Prices Raise Outlook For Global Bond Markets, Lower Inflation. NEW YORK -- Earlier this year, rising energy prices cast a shadow over global bonds. Now, slipping energy costs are brightening prospects for longer maturities, which are the most susceptible to inflation concerns.European Government Bonds may be the chief beneficiary of this shift. The specter of rising inflation fueled by higher energy prices loomed in mid-May, when gasoline futures spiked and crude oil was trading near $29 per barrel.But that worry \"is now off the agenda,\" says Mike Ryan, chief fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber in New York. Global bond markets \"are not overly concerned right now\" about inflation, he says. Against this backdrop, global inflation concerns have been exaggerated, and inflation should fall in many areas of the world by next year in delayed response to slower growth and declining factory-utilization rates, Deutsche Bank strategists expect.\"For all major yield curves,\" this scenario offers \"positive inflation news,\" says Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the euro zone, for instance, inflation is expected to fall to 1.8% in 2002 from 2.7% this year, Deutsche Bank estimates.Declines in global energy prices \"will certainly be welcome\" at the European Central Bank and should give the ECB more elbow room to cut interest rates, says Cary Leahey, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.\n",

      " Letters to the Editor: Exchange Rates. Prof. Allen H. Meltzer's article \"Japan Proved Fixed Rates Not Needed for Stable Growth\" (editorial page, Aug. 20) was very impressive and persuasive. Although I agree with most of his conclusions, I would like to make a few comments.Prof. Meltzer writes, \"Unexpected changes in output are a generally accepted measure of uncertainty and costly economic variability.\" But often a \"change in output\" is simply the standard deviation of real GNP. Realistically, the rate of inflation, trade or current balance of payments, interest rates and effective exchange rate should be included in any economic indicator that measures uncertainty and variability.Second, in his interpretation of the actual function of floating exchange rates, Prof. Meltzer writes, \"Until the September 1985 agreement at the Plaza Hotel, evidence suggests that generally the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuated freely.\" However, if the steady appreciation of the U.S. dollar under the so-called minimum intervention policy since early 1981 can be considered \"free,\" then the sharp appreciation of the yen since September 1985 has also been a \"free\" fluctuation.Third, I fully agree with his conclusion that \"fluctuating exchange rates only contribute to stability if policies are stabilizing.\" In this respect, he leaves me with the impression that at the September 1985 meeting the authorities made realistic efforts to attain stability of exchange rates. I feel, however, that the importance of the agreement was neither that such an effort was made, nor that policies of various countries were coordinated, but that independent policies that each country deems best for its own benefit were coordinated.In this sense, the current efforts in Japan to increase domestic demand are not simply for the sake of the U.S., but in Japan's own interest.\n",

      " Bucking a Trend: Biggest Show of Force In a Decade Halts Slide Of the Dollar -- for Now --- U.S. and Allies Act Together To Stop a Puzzling Fall; Pressure on Fed Increases --- Global No-Confidence Vote?. The Clinton administration, alarmed that the declining dollar threatens its hopes for the U.S. economy, led a 16-nation offensive to prop up the currency.As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared unequivocally for the first time that the dollar has fallen too far, the U.S. recruited allies ranging from Germany to Portugal to buy dollars in the most-coordinated show of force that currency markets have seen in a decade.The intervention met with modest initial success, but the markets are sure to test the dollar again. And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to \"disorderly\" markets and \"volatility,\" Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves \"reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals.\" Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: \"This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.\"Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to \"counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,\" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar. That view gained credence earlier this year when the Treasury failed to act to brake the dollar when it fell sharply against the yen.\n",

      " Alex William and the Crossover Strategy; Prince George's County's first black state's attorney has seen the political future-and it's colorblind. An off-duty, black D.C. police officer arrived at his home in Prince George's County to find signs of a burglary. Moving from room to room in the twilight, he began searching for an intruder. Suddenly, from outside in the yard, a white Prince George's County policeman yelled, \"Freeze!\" Inside, the black policeman spun and lowered his hands as if to fire a gun. The county policeman fired through an open window and the bullet hit the black man in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.The shot, fired at 6:40 p.m. on Dec. 14, 1987, echoed throughout Prince George's, a county with a bitter history of accusations of police brutality against blacks. Alex Williams was on his way home when the phone rang in his car. As he listened to an aide recount the details, he began to squint his eyes and tighten his lips. \"All these emotions came over me,\" he remembers. \" `Oh, my goodness,' I thought. `I've got to deal with this' . . . The black community was up in arms. The rest of the community was watching to see how I was going to handle this . . . It was a lot on me.\"In a county that has seen its black population triple in less than two decades, the case became a test of Alex Williams' political strategy. Williams, the first black chief prosecutor in the 300-year history of Prince George's County, had won election by appealing to black and white voters. Could he continue to get support from both groups in such a racially explosive atmosphere no matter how impartial he was?Blacks demanded an indictment. The county police department investigated and exonerated the officer. Amid cries of \"whitewash,\" Williams decided to conduct his own probe and appointed an independent investigator. The slain man's family tried to bypass local officials altogether, calling for an inquiry by state authorities.In the end, four long months after the slaying, Williams declared it an accident. \"We conducted a thorough special investigation and came up with the facts,\" Williams said. \"We looked at every aspect, met with the family, with all the witnesses, did an autopsy and put it to the grand jury. On the surface it looked clearly racial, but as we got into it, it clearly was not racial. It wasn't a black and white thing . . . We can justify everything we did and our decision not to charge the officer. There is no justification for criticism.\"\n",

      " REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Veto Ax Awaits. Just before flying off to Geneva, President Reagan vetoed a $13.2 billion appropriations bill for the Treasury Department, Postal Service and independent agencies -- his 42nd veto since taking office. While the amount at issue was relatively small, the president's action may be symbolic of a new toughness with Congress. We sincerely hope so, for the president soon will get several important bills he should veto in protection of the national interest.The Treasury-Postal bill was $900 million more than the administration had requested and was even $180 million above Congress's own budget-resolution target. This was largely due to Congress's refusal to cut postal subsidies. In rejecting the measure, Mr. Reagan said that this was just the latest example of an \"ingrained incapacity\" on the part of Congress to \"tackle the large budget deficit.\"\"The presidential veto is an instrument to be used with care,\" Mr. Reagan said. But, he added, \"unless and until a genuine effort is made to control spending, the veto is an instrument I shall not hesitate to employ.\"The administration's budget proposals for fiscal 1986, which started Oct. 1, called for reforming, reducing or eliminating some 50 domestic spending programs. \"The Congress has accepted very few of these proposals, and every non-defense appropriations bill will far exceed my budget,\" the president said. However, the White House has offered Congress an \"accommodation.\" Mr. Reagan said that he would accept bills that were above his own budget as long as they were within Congress's budget-resolution limits. The latest spending bill failed to meet that test.Indeed, the White House promises to take a close look at all discretionary domestic spending; such items are some of the easiest to cut because they don't require amending laws. Specifically, two appropriations proposals that may also see presidential vetoes are for the departments of Transportation and Interior. These measures, which are still being debated on Capitol Hill, look to exceed not only the president's proposals but Congress's own budget limitations.\n",

      " We Can Defeat Our Economic FOEs. Not with a bang but with a whimper. That's how the Clinton-Gore economy stumbles to an end. It's not a pretty sight. But will we end up mired in recession? Don't bet on it. We should skirt a recession and resume our prosperous march, as long as Congress supports, rather than undermines, President-elect George W. Bush.As we enter the Christmas retail season, it's easy to come up with a list of sad data as long as Santa's happy list of holiday gifts. Durable goods orders dropped 5.5% in October and, of course, the Nasdaq Stock Market has lost 32% in 2000. The economic bears are on a rampage, forcing the bulls to hibernate for the winter.How did we get here? Wasn't it just yesterday that gross domestic product growth was galloping at a 5% pace and financial authors sparked a bidding war over Dow 36,000, Dow 40,000 or Dow 100,000? Who broke up the party and launched this battle against our prosperity? Let's use the acronym FOE, pointing our indignant finger at the Federal Reserve Board, OPEC and the euro. Each of these institutions has knocked us a few degrees off course. Of the three, at least the Federal Reserve had good intentions.Back on May 16, the day the Fed pushed up short-term rates by 50 basis points, I suggested on this page that the economy was preparing to slow on its own, and that bond bears worried too much about inflation. (If only my bet on the New York Mets came out so lucky.) \"Be careful what you wish for. . .\" goes the old saw. So now the Fed has achieved the slowdown it tried to engineer. Fewer cars are rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit, and carpenters will hammer fewer nails into new homes this winter. The junk-bond market has slammed its doors, and the Fed reports that bank loan officers have choked lending standards tighter today than during the 1998 credit crunch.On Tuesday, Alan Greenspan prudently and presciently softened his inflation warnings, pointing out that a flabby stock market could \"signal or precipitate a softening\" in spending. For now, at least, we don't have to fret about irrational exuberance in share prices.\n",

It was a lousy year to be a Republican, given the national recession, but right up until the weekend before the vote, Tarrance's polls showed his client cruising toward victory.When Election Day came, however, Clements got swamped by a tidal wave of Democratic voters. A few weeks later, Tarrance saw the vanquished governor at a meeting of the Republican Governors' Association and coined a memorable line when asked how their first post-election session went. \"It was like being Napoleon's intelligence chief after Waterloo,\" Tarrance said.Tarrance's remarkable candor offers a benchmark as the campaign of 2000 heats up. Over the next 14 months, a small army of pollsters will chart the mood of America and offer insights into the psyches of every imaginable demographic slice of the electorate to candidates hungry for the clues that will turn a close contest into victory. The luckiest among them will end up with the unofficial title of \"pollster to the president,\" which will bring fame and no little fortune.But the law of averages says that somewhere along the way, some of these pollsters will get it wrong -- a single poll perhaps, a strategic insight almost certainly, even possibly a whole race, although the odds weigh heavily against that, given the round-the- clock sampling that marks the conclusion of any truly competitive race. You wouldn't guess it from talking to them, however.in the polling business recently to ask what happens when things go wrong. The calls produced few confessional tales of the race that got away or the poll that went awry. As Mark Mellman,a Democratic pollster, put it, \"More often than not it's a matter of interpretation.

Carlyle will pay $880 million for the company and invest $33 million in working capital, according to Rexnord's parent company, Invensys. Rexnord, whose primary products are clutches, brakes and chains, employs 5,000 people at 30 plants worldwide and had sales of about $765 million last year. To pay for it, Carlyle planned to spend about $300 million from its buyout funds and borrow the rest from banks, people familiar with the sale said last week. Carlyle officials could not be reached for comment.MeriStar Hospitality, a hotel real estate investment trust, said its third-quarter results would be lower than expected because of the decline in business travel and the lack of travelers around the Sept. 11 anniversary. MeriStar lowered its third-quarter guidance for revenue per available room and its funds from operations. Revenue per available room would decline 4.5 percent to 5 percent from the third quarter of last year, compared with previous guidance of no change to a 2 percent decline. The forecast for funds from operations per share was lowered to 10 cents to 12 cents, compared with earlier guidance of 20 cents to 25 cents.BB&T, a North Carolina banking company, said Friday that it would buy Equitable Bank, a Wheaton thrift, for $52.6 million in stock. The small Montgomery County bank, founded in 1879, focuses mostly on consumer deposit services and home loans. It has five branches in suburban Maryland, all of which will become BB&T branches. BB&T operates more than 1,100 banks in the Southeast and in recent years has bought a half-dozen banks in Washington, Maryland and Virginia, giving it about $3 billion in assets and more than 60 branches in the region. BB&T is to exchange one share of BB&T for each share of Equitable. That values Equitable at $36.18 a share, a 34 percent premium over its most recent trading price before the deal was announced. Shares of Equitable rose more than $7 Friday to close at $34.47 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The acquisition, which must be approved by regulators and Equitable shareholders, is to be completed in the first quarter of next year.Legg Mason, a Baltimore brokerage firm and money manager, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to $500 million in various securities.

Legg Mason filed what is known as a \"shelf\" offering, used to register securities in advance so companies can sell them quickly when market conditions are favorable or financing needs arise. Terms of the securities are not usually available until the sale period begins.Northrop Grumman said Friday that its Electronic Systems division is laying off about 230 employees at its operations in Maryland, Alabama, New York and Connecticut. About 215 of the layoffs would occur at the division's plants in Linthicum, Annapolis and Sykesville, the Baltimore Sun reported.

      " Team Spirit; Reviewed by Jay R. Mandle. Franklin Foer, armed with a terrific idea, took six months off from his job as a staff writer at the New Republic to tour the soccer capitals of the world. He set out to observe soccer as a way to understand the consequences of globalization -- the increasing interdependence of the world's nations -- by studying a sport in which \"national borders and national identities had been swept into the dustbin of soccer history.\" The result is a travelogue full of important insights into both cultural change and persistence.Foer returned from this global tour convinced that globalization has not and will not soon wipe away local institutions and cultures. On the contrary, he suspects that the opposite has happened: In response to the threat of global integration, local entities have launched counterattacks that are successful but \"not always in such a good way.\" Local blood feuds and corruption have proved to be remarkably persistent. So persistent, in fact, that Foer believes that globalization is not likely to deliver on the promise of a more humane world order that some of its proponents anticipate. That would require a liberal nationalism, a development necessary \"to blunt the return of tribalism.\" Soccer, at its best, shows how this might work. For Foer, the sport demonstrates that \"you could love your country -- even consider it a superior group -- without desiring to dominate other groups or closing yourself off to foreign impulses.\"Regarding the \"not so good ways\" that locals respond to globalism, Foer found much to worry about. The world of soccer can be quite ugly. In Serbia, fans of Red Star Belgrade became, as he puts it, \"Milosevic's shock troops, the most active agents of ethnic cleansing, highly efficient practitioners of genocide.\" The \"unfinished fight over the Protestant Reformation\" is kept alive in the stands in Glasgow. And, at least as he reports it, Margaret Thatcher was not far off the mark when she said that the hooliganism that emerged in soccer during the 1980s was \"a disgrace to civilized society.\"Foer argues that the gruesome antisocial fan behavior that occurs when soccer is at its worst is counterbalanced in other places where the sport plays a role in creating a more humane order. The most interesting and unlikely of these is Iran. During the Islamic Revolution of 1979, women were prohibited from attending soccer games at Tehran's 120,000-seat stadium. But, as Foer tells it, this banning never fully took effect, with some women sneaking into the facility dressed in men's clothes. Pressed by female soccer fans, the ruling Iranian clergy issued a new fatwa in 1987 that allowed women to watch games on television, though the ban on attendance remained in place.This compromise could not survive the jubilation that followed the Iranian national team's successful capture of a World Cup berth in 1997. The team itself was at least to some extent a participant in the liberal global order: Its coach was a Brazilian who wore a necktie, an accessory that the ruling clergy considered a European imposition. But the victory celebration and its aftermath were even more important. Foer reports that many of the younger celebrants were women, some of whom danced with uncovered heads. Further, at the official celebration at the stadium, when women were denied entrance they mounted a demonstration. They shouted, \"Aren't we part of this nation? We want to celebrate too. We aren't ants.\" Ultimately they broke through the police barriers and joined the mass victory party. Foer compares this \"football revolution\" to the Boston Tea Party. He notes that the event will \"go down as the moment when the people first realized that they could challenge their tyrannical rulers.\" As the United States looks for ways to encourage liberalism within Islam, an event such as this deserves attention. Its impact suggests that Paul Wolfowitz, if no one else, should read this account.\n",

      " PAC Money Flows Freely To a Would-Be Reformer Series: UNEASY INCUMBENTS: THE FRESHMAN CLASS OF '92 Series Number: occ.. Over a buffet lunch of shrimp linguine, charcoal-broiled chicken and grilled vegetables, Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) picked up more than $15,000 in contributions he didn't even have to ask for.All he had to do was show up at a private room at the National Democratic Club here and answer questions about health care, crime, entitlements and his campaign for reelection. His benefactors were representatives of a coalition of 16 unions and other groups that speak for more than 2 million federal and postal employees and retirees. Collectively, their political action committees (PACs) dole out $10 million each election cycle to candidates and political parties.\"I tell you,\" Strickland boasted to his hosts, \"I am proud of the money I get from you. It's from real people, working people.\"Two years ago as a challenger, Strickland was visiting PAC offices and hustling contributions by phone to raise enough money to unseat Rep. Bob McEwen (R). Now, he is the incumbent and contributions are flowing more freely - sometimes without solicitation.In some respects, as freshmen lawmakers such as Strickland reap the benefits of incumbency, they become more entrenched in the system they campaigned to reform. This poses a dilemma for many in the Class of '92, the largest and most diverse collection of House newcomers in decades: How do they maintain credibility as outsiders with the voters back home if they behave like insiders in Washington? \"The great majority of freshmen ran in 1992 on changing the political system in Washington,\" said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan public interest lobbying group. \"The majority made public commitments to support comprehensive campaign finance reform. But once they got here there were only a handful of representatives who really worked at it. A great majority of the freshmen did not deliver on the impression they left with their constituents that they were really going to try to change this place.\"\n",

      " Los Angeles Port Boycott Hits Key Economic Link. AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalJointly, the neighboring ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which make up Los Angeles Harbor, account for about 25% of all U.S. container traffic. For Los Angeles and Southern California, the commercial role is far broader.\"International trade is perhaps the single most important driving force in the region's economy in the 1990s, and will continue to be a driving force in the years to come,\" says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates Inc. in West Chester, Pa. \"The port has been a key part of that flow.\"Even during the dark days of Southern California's recession in the early 1990s, foreign trade continued to grow. \"In many senses, it saved us,\" says Jack Kyser, chief economist of Economic Development Corp., a research group in Los Angeles. \"There were days when I was feeling a lot of pain, and I would call someone down at the port to brighten my day.\" The rising tide of foreign traffic totaled $157 billion of imports and exports last year.But the seeds of labor friction were sown in this growth, shipping-industry analysts say. As more ships have arrived, trade has relied increasingly on what is now believed to be about 6,500 truckers who haul containers between the harbor and delivery points. Mostly independent owners and operators of often-battered trucks, these drivers have been a low-paid and often-pressured link in a system that moved as many as 10,000 containers a day across a few dozen miles of freeway. The drivers are a largely immigrant, Hispanic group. Their numbers have grown with cargo volume. Competition kept haul rates low. And pay has effectively further declined in many cases, shipping insiders say, as truckers, paid by the haul, have been slowed by traffic with the growing cargo volume.\n",

      " The Weekend Interview with Charles Schwab: Talking to Chuck. San Francisco -- Perhaps no one on the globe has come to symbolize the rise of the investor class in America in recent decades more than Charles Schwab.When Mr. Schwab, or \"Chuck,\" as nearly everyone calls him, opened his first brokerage office in 1971, the stock market was pretty much the exclusive sandbox of the richest 5-10% of Americans. Today, thanks in no small part to his company's financial market innovations, investing has been thoroughly \"democratized,\" as he puts it, with more than half of working class adults now owners of stock.Creating wealth is what Mr. Schwab has come to regard as his \"life's pursuit.\" He's accomplished that not just for himself -- his stake in the company is estimated at $4 billion -- but also for the millions of small investors who first came to be owner-capitalists by opening a Schwab account. So who better to discuss the future of financial markets and investing than the man who revolutionized the brokerage business?I visited Mr. Schwab recently at the firm's headquarters in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Mr. Schwab is astonishingly muscular and fit for a grandfather who turns 70 this weekend. Throughout our conversation -- which took place in his 30th-floor office overlooking the Bay -- he is cordial but intense. He speaks of the company as if it is one of his children, and he doesn't seem to be in any hurry to surrender the helm.I ask him what he means by his favorite term, \"democratic capitalism.\" He replies that the stock market today is \"an open tent for anybody to come into.\" Ever the salesman, he adds: \"For as little as a thousand dollars, you can open an account at Schwab. I mean, it's not a big barrier to entry.\"\n",

      " Stock Options May Be Curtailed. Most technology companies are considering cutting back their use of stock options to reward employees or changing to other forms of stock compensation, in a further sign that the glory days of stock options are past, according to a survey of top executives in the high-tech industry.In the survey of top corporate executives at 196 companies by the technology, media and telecommunications practice of consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 65% of tech companies overall and 83% of public companies say they are looking at alternatives to stock options, which grant employees and executives the right to buy company stock at a fixed price during a specified period. Instead, most public technology companies, 63%, plan to issue restricted stock or stock units -- actual awards of stock or promises to grant such stock in the future.The results of the survey show the extent to which technology companies are shifting away from a form of compensation that made fortunes for many tech workers in the 1990s. Options have fallen out of favor among rank-and-file employees as stock-market declines made many options worthless. At the same time, investors and regulators have blamed option plans for their role in scandals at companies like Enron Corp., where executives cashed out large numbers of options before bad news broke. Already, high-profile tech companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have stopped issuing options to employees in favor of restricted stock units.Another factor in the changes, the Deloitte survey says, is a coming \"drought\" in options: Seventy-two percent of the survey's respondents expect to run out of shares to grant to employees within two years. New rules adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market this year require shareholder approval of new stock compensation plans.Many technology companies continue to resist dropping options, in part because favorable accounting rules have allowed them to exclude option expenses from their financial results. Accounting regulators are expected eventually to require companies to treat options as an expense. Still, 92% of public tech companies surveyed by Deloitte said they aren't expensing stock options yet.\n",

At first glance, the insulation material factory in this mid-sized city doesn't look noteworthy: drab buildings, yellow plastic sheets rolling off assembly lines, mounds of coal lying beside generators.But the Star Insulation Materials Joint Stock Co. is supposed to be a model for China's future. Four and a half years ago, it changed from a state-owned enterprise to one owned by its employees, and to hear company chairman Dou Baorong describe it, it was as though a magic wand were waved over the place. Output increased seven-fold, productivity tripled, tax payments rose 12-fold and profits soared 16-fold.\"The old system made workers lazy,\" said Dou, who now owns 8.4 percent of the company and gets a chunk of the profits in addition to his salary. Ni Shaobo, assistant to the general manager, added: \"Before, it was the company that answered for it if performance was bad. Now it's all of us who answer for it.\"Star Insulation is just one of hundreds of Chinese companies that have experimented with different forms of ownership, moving off the government dole and seeking more commercially viable footing. At the Chinese Communist Party congress that starts today, China's rulers are expected to endorse these companies as models for thousands of state-owned enterprises around the country, giving a push to a massive privatization process that so far has been regarded as experimental.\"Quite possibly, the world's largest privatization is going on right now in China,\" said Barry Naughton, a University of California at San Diego economist who specializes in China. It makes former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's privatization efforts look small; more people work for Chinese state companies than live in all of Britain.\n",

      " Global Austerity: War on Inflation Curbs World-Wide Growth Too Much, Some Say --- Central Banks Are Criticized For Keeping Rates High, Depressing Job Markets --- The U.S. Is in the Best Shape. AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalBut why can't it? A small but growing chorus of critics is beginning to question the mainstream view and ask whether economic policy makers aren't waging the wrong war.Bruised by two decades of inflation and deficits, officials here and in other industrialized countries are keeping tight rein on budget and monetary policies; they are determined not to repeat past mistakes. In the process, some fear, they may also be throttling the chances of job-creating expansion around the world. This new wave of government austerity, critics argue, saps potential growth in many mature industrial economies even as those in Asia and elsewhere are soaring, heralding a historic shift in economic power.The fast-growth gang extends beyond the usual cliques of liberal economists and supply-side enthusiasts. And it extends beyond Clinton-administration officials with their eyes on the November election. Included are people from across the political spectrum, both here and abroad, plus a growing number of corporate bosses. They contend that the world economy has changed fundamentally, and they complain that central bankers, led by the Federal Reserve, respond too slowly. Low unemployment won't trigger higher prices as it once did, they say; instead, global competition and corporate restructuring will keep prices down, while productivity gains will let growth flourish.Above all, the critics want central bankers to relax their tight-money policies. \"We have to be willing to take more risks\" for faster growth, says Dana Mead, chief executive of Tenneco Inc., the Houston energy giant. \"We can't afford not to.\" Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says a recent survey finds an overwhelming majority of manufacturing executives calling for lower rates. High rates \"are choking off growth,\" he says. \"We need a more pro-growth policy coming from Washington.\" John F. Welch, General Electric Co.'s chief executive, says the economy can safely grow faster than its current 2% rate, \"and we ought to let it.\"\n",

      " The Agony of the Left. CorrectionAn editorial page article, \"The Agony of the Left\" (Oct. 4), incorrectly stated where a Salman Rushdie article had appeared. It ran in the Washington Post, not the New York Times. (WSJ Oct. 16, 2001)One of the most telling things I have seen since the Sept. 11 massacre was an early \"peace movement\" e-mail. It listed three major demands: stop the war; stop racism; stop ethnic scapegoating. A liberal friend had appended a sardonic comment to the bottom. \"Any chance we could come out against terrorism as well?\"One of the overlooked aspects of the war we are now fighting is the awakening it has spawned on the left. In one atrocity, Osama bin Laden may have accomplished what a generation of conservative writers have failed to do: convince mainstream liberals of the illogic and nihilism of the powerful postmodern left. For the first time in a very long while, many liberals are reassessing -- quietly for the most part -- their alliance with the anti-American, anti-capitalist forces they have long appeased, ignored or supported.Of course the initial response of left-wing intellectuals to Sept. 11 was one jerking of the collective knee. This was America's fault. From Susan Sontag to Michael Moore, from Noam Chomsky to Edward Said, there was no question that, however awful the attack on the World Trade Center, it was vital to keep attention fixed on the real culprit: the United States. Of the massacre, a Rutgers professor summed up the consensus by informing her students that \"We should be aware that, whatever its proximate cause, its ultimate cause is the fascism of U.S. foreign policy over the past many decades.\" Or as a poster at the demonstrations in Washington last weekend put it, \"Amerika, Get A Clue.\"\n",

      " Corporate News: Union Says Talks Stall With ArcelorMittal. PITTSBURGH -- The United Steelworkers union says it is close to a new four-year labor pact with U.S. Steel Corp. but that talks with ArcelorMittal have stalled, prompting both sides to prepare for a strike if a resolution or extension isn't reached.The stakes are high for both companies and their collective 26,000 U.S. workers, as well as the domestic steel industry and its customers. The companies, trying to control costs and compete with each other in the tight-margin steel business, consider the last labor deals -- negotiated in 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted -- a heavy burden. Meanwhile, steelworkers are trying to cling to gains and jobs amid stagnant wages and stubbornly high unemployment, and are concerned with ArcelorMittal's insistence on a two-tiered wage scale, which would be a first among major unionized domestic steel producers.Negotiations with ArcelorMittal are at a dead end, say union bargainers. \"As the clock continues to tick, ArcelorMittal continues to signal that it wants a confrontation,\" USW leaders wrote to members on Wednesday, in an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. USW, which has a $210 million strike fund, also outlined what would happen in case of a strike but noted that its leaders have not yet voted to authorize a strike. \"That's a strategic decision and we're not going to paint ourselves into a corner,\" said spokesman Tony Montana, who declined to comment on the odds of a strike.ArcelorMittal, which wants to cut wages and benefits for all workers by more than $28 an hour, or 36% from an average $77.40 an hour in 2011, has started preparing its blast furnaces and other facilities for a strike \"as a precautionary measure and consistent with measures taken during past labor negotiations,\" according to spokesman Bill Steers. However, he said the company is \"in continuous dialogue with the United Steelworkers and remains optimistic about reaching a fair and equitable contract with the USW without a work stoppage.\"ArcelorMittal, which has the capacity in Europe and Canada to replace lost production in the U.S. in the event of a strike, is pushing hard for a two-tier wage scale -- with new workers being paid a lower wage and receiving no company pension. It also wants the right to suspend health-care benefits if the Affordable Care Act is put into effect and workers can buy health care on exchanges, the union says.\n",

Apple Computer Inc., in a bid to increase its retail presence and boost market share, said it plans about $200 million in capital expenditures in the current fiscal year.According to the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker's annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Apple's capital expenditure for fiscal 2002 will go toward replacing existing capital assets, improving its corporate infrastructure and developing more Apple-branded retail stores.Apple, which launched 27 of its own retail stores across the country this year, devoted about $92 million to the initiative during its fiscal 2001 ended Sept. 30, out of total captial spending of $232 million, according to the filing. More Apple stores are being planned for fiscal 2002, the filing states, but didn't specify how many.Apple's total capital-expenditure plans, while down from a year earlier, underline its effort to continue reaching out to customers through company-owned stores. The computer maker, which has world-wide market share of about 5%, has long maintained that customers need to feel and touch its Macintosh systems in order to fully appreciate the products.Since Apple opened its first stores in May 2001, the company has followed a model of locating stores in high-traffic locations such as urban shopping districts and malls. In addition to selling its own computers, Apple's stores also carry a variety of third-party software and devices such as video cameras and hand-held computers. The company originally anticipated that its stores would break even by early next year, but modified those expectations after the Sept. 11 attacks.

      " The Evening Wrap: Immobilized. The Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, but it was hardly out of complacency.Caught between heightened inflation fears and persistent concerns about a sluggish economy, Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers decided to leave the Fed's key short-term interest rate unchanged at 2%. The non-move marked the end of a series of rate cuts dating back to last summer, when credit woes were creeping up on the economy. The latest vote was 9-1, with Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, once again dissenting, this time opting for a rate increase. And, indeed, recent comments from Fed personages -- including Wednesday's commentary -- suggest the bank's next rate move will be upward. \"Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased,\" the Fed said in its statement. The bank is in a bit of a pickle. Reporter Sudeep Reddy writes that Fed officials are trying to avoid rate increases for now to avoid exacerbating the weakness in employment, financial markets and the housing sector. At the same time, they are trying to signal they're serious about fighting inflation by talking about the risks of rising inflation expectations and suggesting a willingness to act quickly if inflation expectations get out of hand. Assuming commodity prices don't go completely haywire, some economists think that won't happen, as the weakening economy, particularly the rising unemployment rate, restrain wages and a willingness to spend. Indeed, Joseph Brusuelas of Merk Investments thinks a rate increase won't be happening anytime soon. \"We anticipate that the rate hike currently priced in [by markets] for September will wither away in the heat of the summer slowdown in the economy,\" he said. Likewise, PNC economist Stuart Hoffman, while now more convinced that the Fed's next move will be an increase, sees the federal-funds rate holding at 2% until \"late 2008 or early 2009.\"---Stocks Inch UpThe Federal Reserve's announcement gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average a quick boost, but in the end the blue-chip gauge was ahead only 4.40 points, or 0.04%, at 11811.83.

      " At CBS, Another Black Eye Blurs Vision of Future. How's this for high-concept television: A great network lifts itself out of the ratings cellar and rides high for three years. Then, all at once, things get rocky. The network loses its top programming executive, its high-profile sports shows, even some of its affiliates. As executives search desperately for a new hit, the ratings start to look shaky again.This scenario, as they say on TV, is based on a true story. CBS, the dominant television network of the early '90s, appears headed for a fall. Despite winning a ratings triple crown during the last television season - taking the top spot in the prime time, daytime and late night Nielsens - in recent months the network of \"Murphy Brown\" and \"Late Night With David Letterman\" has been showing clear signs of deterioration.Last week, Black Rock, as CBS's New York headquarters is known, was shaken anew. New World Communications Group Inc., which owns eight TV stations affiliated with CBS, said it was shifting its loyalties to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The move was widely read as a coup for Fox, which paid $500 million for the stations' affiliation, and as a major defeat for CBS. Indeed, the stock market's judgment was swift and harsh: Investors rushed to sell their CBS shares, knocking nearly $520 million off the company's value on paper in two days (the stock recovered slightly later in the week).CBS executives argue that the reaction to the New World-Fox deal was overblown. After all, they said, with its powerful prime time lineup, CBS should have no trouble persuading other stations in the eight markets to sign up to carry \"60 Minutes,\" \"Murder, She Wrote\" and other CBS fare. Fox, sniffed CBS Broadcasting Group President Howard Stringer last week, is a network of \"downscale sitcoms and titillating soap operas.\"In fact, Fox - whose ratings have declined 10 percent in the past two years - needs the soon-to-be former CBS affiliates more than CBS. Once it finds stations to replace those it has lost, CBS's \"worst case\" internal projections call for it to lose about 15 percent of its current audience in the eight cities.\n",

      " Postal Service Is Close to a Deal To Raise Rates as Soon as Midyear. The U.S. Postal Service and the country's largest mailers are close to agreeing on a compromise that would boost postage rates as soon as June but stave off an even bigger increase threatened by the post office in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the recession.The deal, which includes accepting the Postal Service's proposal of late September to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents, follows two months of negotiations aimed at avoiding skirmishes that usually cause the rate-setting process to drag on for about a year.The settlement calls for the higher rates to take effect at least three months earlier than the October implementation the Postal Service originally projected, giving the agency a much-needed revenue infusion. The agency reported a $1.7 billion loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2001, and it has predicted a similar result for the current fiscal year.The compromise still must clear several hurdles and could fall apart if not enough of the 58 companies, industry groups and other parties in the pending rate-increase case support the deal. A Postal Service spokesman said about two-thirds of the parties had indicated by yesterday's deadline they would go along with the settlement; the agency's board will decide early next week whether to endorse the deal, which it is expected to do.Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, the largest trade group for the direct-mail industry, said there are \"a significant number of major parties that have at least informally stated that they would sign the agreement . . . [or] will not oppose it.\" Mr. Cerasale's group agreed to the compromise after the Postal Service abandoned its push for a settlement that would have boosted postal rates June 2, instead of the current plan of no sooner than June 30, giving mailers more time to prepare for the rate increases.\n",

      " As the U.S. Prepares to Hand Over the Canal, Uncertain Panamanians Find Themselves . . .; WADING INTO MURKY WATERS. Taped to the side of Jose Gabriel Gonzalez's snack cart is a handwritten note asking, \"WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE CANAL NOW?\" The question testifies to his anxiety about what will happen after Dec. 31, when the United States pulls out the last of its troops and the Panama Canal comes under full Panamanian control.\"I have great worries,\" said Gonzalez, whose cart occupies a busy street corner here. \"I have lost my sense of security. I have never known Panama without the Americans being here.\"Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate.Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero.In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent. Some polls have even found that a majority of Panamanians would like the United States to retain control of the 50-mile-long canal, or, at least, operate it in partnership with Panama similar to the current arrangement.\n",

      " CAPITAL: U.S. Is Back From the Precipice. So is it over? Have governments in the U.S. and Europe finally found the cure? Has recession been averted?No. We're still in for a rough recession, with U.S. unemployment, now at 6.1%, likely to rise above 8%, with all the misery that brings.But it could be worse. For a few scary moments last week, governments began to take action to protect their own countries that made other countries worse off. It looked like the world economy was lurching uncomfortably close to conditions that precipitated the Great Depression. The newfound trans-Atlantic unity -- particularly the move by the U.K., then the rest of Europe and now the U.S., to give the banking system a taxpayer-funded transfusion -- has significantly reduced the odds of a really bad outcome. That alone is reason to be less panicky today than many were this time last week.Paul Krugman, the newest Nobel laureate in economics, described in a CNBC interview Tuesday the latest government action as \"emergency battlefield medicine to keep the guy from bleeding to death.\" That's no small accomplishment given how bad the wounds were. If the treatments work as intended, banks should resume lending at least to each other, a necessary step toward recovery.The new U.S. plan \"is going to boost confidence that the most extreme downside risks have been diminished, but the damage has been done, and this isn't going to prevent the economy from being in recession and remaining weak for a while,\" Laurence Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Federal Reserve governor, said Tuesday.

      " Heeding The Voice of Silent Cal. The chief business of the American people is business, Calvin Coolidge famously said seven decades ago. If Silent Cal were around today, he might conclude that Bill Clinton's chief business as president has been the politics of business.From imposing trade sanctions on China to helping Mexico out of its financial jam, from fighting the budget deficit in his early presidential days of economic recovery to presenting his new, mildly reflationary budget, the president has steered a steady course of placating American business interests and seeking the financial markets' authenticating approval.No surprise there. Clinton's concern with holding the strong support he got from the business community in 1992 and steadying the markets has long been evident. But David Alan Munro writes from Laguna Beach, Calif., to put the administration's quest for approval from Wall Street in a broader, more speculative perspective.\"There will always be a main non-governmental entity -- for example, the Church prior to the Reformation -- from which government seeks approval or legitimacy,\" writes Munro, a retired history professor. \"That entity has been finance-capital for a long, long time.\"Today Munro believes that the \"authenticating mechanism\" for government and politicians is shifting from financial markets to the media, which Clinton alternately courts and assails. Caught on the cusp of this transformation and not sure which way to turn, the Clintonites \"are in for a rough ride\" in 1996, the professor notes with sympathy.\n",

      " Wanted: Crisis Manager in Chief; A Key Challenge in Auto Bailout Is Finding 'Czar' to Oversee Change. President Richard Nixon appointed the first energy czars, John Love and later William Simon, in the wake of the 1973 gasoline shortage. Congress mandated a drug czar during the crack cocaine epidemic in 1982. And President Bill Clinton named Ira Magaziner his health czar to craft legislation in 1993.It's hardly a record of success; problems persist in all those areas. But with the automobile companies in crisis and the public tired of providing bailouts for American corporations, Congress and the Bush administration are on the verge of creating a new czar or committee to oversee efforts to rescue Detroit's largest automakers.\"If they can no longer pay their own way, it is entirely appropriate for someone to put the hammer down and say 'That's it,' \" said Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the court-appointed monitor for the scandal-ridden communications giant, WorldCom. \"If taxpayers are going to support General Motors, let's turn General Motors into a company worthy of it.\"The choice of a czar -- or czarina -- is the plan's first obstacle. President Bush, who would appoint the czar or overseers, and Democratic leaders in Congress have very different ideas about who would make the best choice.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) mentioned former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker as the type of person she would support. As he exited an hour-long meeting with House Democrats yesterday afternoon, Volcker waved off reporters' questions, declining to state whether he was interested in the post. Volcker has already been tapped to advise President-elect Barack Obama on economic issues.\n",

      " K-Tel Stock Soars 45% as News of Plan To Sell Music Over Internet Proves a Hit. K-Tel International Inc., long known for peddling music on late-night television, has another hit on its hands: K-Tel stock.Early last week, the company's shares changed hands at less than $7 a share. But with word spreading of the company's plans to sell music on-line, K-Tel shares have marched steadily higher. After gaining more than $22 last week, K-Tel shares were up another $12.9375, or 45%, yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, closing at $41.625.Before the company's announcement less than two weeks ago of its plan to sell music over the Internet, K-Tel had so little attention that its shares didn't even trade on some days. With just 4.1 million shares outstanding, K-Tel's market capitalization has gone from about $30 million to $170 million in a week.Yesterday, the stock's volume was an astonishing 14.2 million shares, or more than three times the number of shares outstanding. Analysts said traders who had sold K-Tel shares short, betting on a decline in the stock price, were among the buyers in recent days.All this for a company that in its year ended June 30, posted net income of $3.2 million, or 81 cents a share, on sales of $75.5 million.\n",

      " Durables Orders Post 0.9% Drop For Last Month --- Bookings for Non-Defense Capital Goods Fall 6.3%, Third Decline in a Row. WASHINGTON -- Orders for durable manufactured products dropped 0.9% in August, while a related indicator of business investment plummeted for the third consecutive month, the Commerce Department said.The orders report is a crude and highly volatile measure of business activity, but it does suggest the economy may be slowing more sharply than most economists have predicted.Orders for non-defense capital goods, an indicator of business plans to invest in new equipment, plunged 6.3% in August, following a 2.5% decline in July and a 3.2% drop in June. Many analysts had been counting on business investment to propel the economy in coming months, now that consumer spending seems to have slowed. But if orders for capital goods continue to decline and consumer spending stays weak, the economic expansion could fizzle out in the next few months.Nevertheless, economic forecasters continue to believe that the economy will perk up this fall. \"The key is September and October,\" said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. \"Some of the weakness in the summer was temporary. My own feeling is we will see moderate growth over the rest of this year and 1985.\"\"I think we will see some pickup in the fourth quarter,\" agreed John McAuley, vice president for economic research at Chemical Bank, New York. Analysts are looking for growth in the nation's output, or gross national product, at an annual rate of 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter after adjustment for inflation, compared with the Commerce Department's estimate of 3.6% for the third quarter.\n",

      " Mexico Lines Up Loans as Vote Nears. Mexico said yesterday that it had lined up more than $20 billion in loans and lines of credit that it might tap in an effort to ensure economic stability during next year's presidential election.The loans, which include some that were previously pledged and others that renew existing credit lines, come from the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. and Canadian governments, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. The money is aimed at keeping President Ernesto Zedillo's six-year term from ending the way nearly all of his recent predecessors' terms have ended -- in a panicky flight by investors and lenders fearful that the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. In many past election years, the government has gone on spending binges aimed at winning support for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.\"This will provide us with the conditions necessary to have an orderly economic transition at the end of the six-year administration,\" Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of Mexico's central bank, said at a news conference in Mexico City.The move comes amid nervousness in financial markets that next year's elections, which are expected to be hotly contested, could be afflicted by the sort of political instability, economic mismanagement and capital flight that caused the peso to plunge in 1994, weeks after Zedillo's electoral victory. The peso crisis rocked global markets and prompted the Clinton administration to lead a $50 billion bailout for Mexico that sparked criticism on Capitol Hill.The administration, the IMF and their allies contend that this time around, Mexico is in much better economic shape and will use its international support to buttress sensible policies. The government has won praise from economists for keeping its budget and trade deficits under control, and Zedillo has sworn to keep from repeating the mistakes of his predecessors. The loans are designed to guard against a sudden loss of investor confidence by providing the government with extra resources if the need arises and by assuring markets the government is sticking to a sound policy path.\n",

      " The Great Terror; A massive new history of Hitler's tyranny.. Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally \"The Road to War\" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. \"Why should I nationalize the industry?\" he once said. \"I shall nationalize the people\" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that \"the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939.\" (\"Clearly\"? And did Hitler plan for \"a prolonged conflict\"?) But on page 409, he states that \"the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered.\" Another contradiction: \"Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end.\" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence.\n",

      " Put Brake On Taxes This Year. In 1990, when the county's piggyback income tax rate was 50 percent, the Montgomery County Council voted to place on the ballot a charter amendment limiting annual growth in county property tax revenues, not counting new growth, to 100 percent of the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index. The voters approved. For 11 years, the council adhered to the limit. Then in fiscal year 2003, the council voted to exceed the limit by $8 million, in FY 2004 by $30 million and now in FY 2005 it is considering $45 million. The camel's nose is in the tent; here comes the camel!Now, our supersized county government has increased the piggyback income tax rate to 60 percent, a $150 million annual increase. It has also doubled the telephone tax, tripled the energy tax, increased sewer, water and trash rates, and given us new cell phone and development taxes. The county's budget first broke $2 billion in FY 1998 but passed the $3 billion mark only six years later in FY 2004, while inflation was at record lows and the population was increasing only 8.5 percent. I have been unable to find any other U.S. county where the rate of increase in the budget was six times the rate of increase of population growth during this period.So, I have led a successful petition drive to place a question on this November's ballot, reenacting the County Council's own property tax revenue limit but eliminating its ability to override it (which it now can do with seven of nine votes).While spending 10-hour days collecting the 15,000 signatures, I encountered a small but very aggressive minority bitterly opposed to any property tax limit. I would ask them if there was any tax they did not want to increase.Inevitably, they would answer \"no.\" The problem is that our group- think, spend-along-to-get-along county executive and council are all in this minority. They can govern only when revenues are rapidly increasing. If our question fails, they'll think they have a green light for more huge tax increases.\n",

      " Ready or Not, Here Comes the Euro. The other day I visited my local bank and bought $30 each of French francs, German marks and Italian lire. I have no immediate need for them or the Spanish pesetas, Greek drachmas or Dutch guilders that I might also have purchased. I just wanted some historic mementos, because after Jan. 1 the national currencies of 12 European countries with 305 million people are scheduled to disappear in favor of the euro. Although I have long doubted the euro's benefits, the moment is undeniably historic.Never before have so many people in so many countries simultaneously adopted a new money. Since 1999 stores and banks have priced in both euros and national currency; now people get the real stuff. The conversion is a massive operation. The European Central Bank (ECB) has minted 52 billion new coins (170 for each person in the \"euro area\") and printed 14.9 billion bank notes (49 per person). The total value is 649 billion euros, which, at present exchange rates (1 euro equals about 90 cents), is about $584 billion.Throughout history, money -- its creation or destruction -- has always been a political act. The euro has been controversial precisely because it engages vast political ambitions. To critics, it represents a step toward \"a European super-state that will submerge the individuality of the European nations in an unwieldy federation, hobbled by bureaucracy [that imposes] a crippling burden of regulatory and other costs on Europe's economies,\" wrote one British commentator. Having reservations, three of the European Union's 15 members -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden -- have so far rejected the euro.To its enthusiasts, the euro means economic vitality and political unity. Companies won't have to convert all those different currencies. Easier cross-border price comparisons will compel firms to become more efficient. As cross-border investment rises, money will increasingly go to the most deserving companies. Economic success will strengthen a European consciousness.Let's hope so. But I'm skeptical, because I fear that (a) the euro won't create major economic gains and that (b) it will trigger a political backlash. So much economic power is being centralized in Frankfurt and Brussels -- the homes of the ECB and the European Commission -- that local and global economic discontent may focus increasingly on \"Europe\" as the villain.\n",

      " IBM Earnings Declined 7.7% In 2nd Quarter --- Drop Exceeded Forecasts; Full-Year Net Expected To Fall for Second Time. NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp.'s second-quarter profit fell 7.7%, making it likely the big computer maker's full-year net income will fall for the second year in a row.Earnings -- at $2.12 a share -- were below Wall Street's expectations. IBM's report, issued at the start of trading, helped push down the overall stock market and many technology issues. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, IBM closed at $139.25 a share, down $3.875.Earnings would have fallen further except for a lower tax rate and a weaker dollar overseas this year. Securities analysts had predicted per-share net of $2.20 to $2.30. Many analysts now expect IBM's earnings to drop for all of 1986, which would give the company its first back-to-back yearly earnings decline since 1933.\"IBM is going to have a down year for sure; it would take a miracle to show otherwise,\" said Ulric Weil, a securities analyst in Washington. He expects IBM to have 1986 net of $10 a share, and he says, \"that's not a rock-bottom number at all.\" In 1985, IBM's net declined slightly to $6.56 billion, or $10.67 a share, on revenue of $50.06 billion.To match last year's earnings, IBM would have to exceed its second-half results for 1985, when profit rose 11% to $4.16 billion, or $6.76 a share.\n",

      " Clinton Praises Kohl; German's Campaign Gets a Needed Boost. Trailing in the polls with election day just four months away, Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a much-needed boost today from President Clinton, who heaped praise on Europe's longest-serving leader during a tour that had all the appearances of a political campaign.After celebrating one of the defining moments of the Cold War by marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, at Tempelhof Airport, Clinton escorted Kohl aboard Air Force One for a short flight to Eisenach, a town in the former Communist part of eastern Germany where they toured a modern car plant built by General Motors Corp.Clinton's visit was the first by a U.S. president to eastern Germany, and it was welcomed by Kohl, who lags far behind his Social Democratic rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls.Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990. \"Thanks in no small measure to the leadership of your chancellor, Germany today is one nation, in harmony with its neighbors,\" Clinton told a packed town square, as a beaming Kohl reveled in the praise of his foreign guest.During a foreign policy address Wednesday at Berlin's Schauspielhaus, a famous opera house located on what was once the Communist side of the Berlin Wall, Clinton extolled Kohl's record as chancellor for the past 16 years in terms that sounded like either an endorsement or a political eulogy.\n",

In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, GT's shares fell 50 cents to close at $19.GT's move comes as the CD-ROM industry churns out more titles than retailers can promote and market. Andrew Gregor, senior vice president of GT Interactive, said he expects the industry to go through a major consolidation period, one that will result in six or seven major companies dominating at least 80% of the industry within a few years.\"The model is the record or film studio business,\" said Mr. Gregor. \"Content will always be very important, but there is a lot of content out there. What distinguishes a successful company is the ability to distribute product.\" Mr. Gregor estimated there are more than 15,000 CD-ROM titles for sale today, although the average mass merchant has room to stock 300.GT Interactive, which went public last December, made its mark in the multimedia field as the distributor of Doom, one of the country's most successful CD-ROM action titles.

Sharron Angle, 60, could be enjoying the 10 grandchildren she loves even more than her .44 magnum. Instead, she is the Republican nominee against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's quest for a fifth term as senator. Her campaign began, in a sense, three decades ago, when a judge annoyed her.When her son was depressed about having to repeat kindergarten -- \"He was a 6-year-old dropout\" -- she decided on home schooling, which Nevada law permitted. But a judge construed the law to require that parents who home-school must live at least 50 miles from a public school.She and many kindred spirits descended on Carson City to get the Legislature to correct this. One legislator, irritated by such grass-roots impertinence, said, \"If I'd known there would be 500 people here instead of 50 and it would take five hours instead of 30 minutes, I would have thrown it [the legislation] in my drawer, and it would never have seen the light of day.\" Angle asked a cowboy standing next to her, \"Can he do that?\" The cowboy said yep. She has been politically incandescent ever since.Even when asked where she was born, she is on message: \"I was conceived in Lovelock [Nevada] but -- if you're not pro-life -- I was born in Klamath Falls [Oregon].\" During her four terms in Nevada's 42-seat Assembly, many votes were \"41-to-Angle.\" She wears as a badge of honor having been voted Nevada's worst legislator, a disparagement she says is always bestowed on a conservative because the voters are members of the press and the political class (the legislators and their staff).Her favorite legislators? U.S. Sens. Jim DeMint and Tom Coburn and Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann. They are coming here to help her.

      " Speaking of Business: Brady Appoints Himself to the Fed. This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System, and some members of Congress think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank. After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining.The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup, for instance, may be out of date. In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed. Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism; the Fed, after all, is a national central bank.Some of the would-be reformers, however, want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it. In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board. But in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board.Carter Glass, a former treasury secretary who was then back in Congress, probably influenced the decision. He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and, somehow, he didn't think that was a good thing.Times have changed. Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has introduced a bill in Congress, co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), that would put the treasury secretary back on the board. There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something. So far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board.\n",

      " Soft Selling: Advertisers Make Their Pitches on Floppy Disks. LATER THIS MONTH, Buick will run magazine ads encouraging consumers to write in for a copy of its 1987 sales brochure. But not just anyone will qualify for one, and it will hardly be your run-of-the-mill auto catalog. What the General Motors division plans to do is mail 20,000 floppy disks to users of Apple personal computers. The strategy: Create a high-tech image for Buick while also making car shopping easier and more fun.When people pop the software into a computer, the screen will light up with animated drawings of pistons and crankshafts chugging away and shock absorbers bouncing up and down. By pressing a few buttons, computer users can load the trunk with luggage and place stick-figure drawings of Mom, Dad, Junior and the family dog into the car's seats. Getting down to more serious business, they will be able to compare the standard equipment and mileage of a Buick with such competitive makes as Nissan and BMW, and calculate their monthly payments for different Buick models. \"Our disk allows people to ask questions at their leisure without all the sales pressure of a dealer showroom,\" says Patrick Harrison, a Buick marketing manager.Buick is on the inside track of a brand new advertising medium. As personal computers spread to more homes and offices, a growing number of direct marketers are putting their sales spiels on software which they believe will get lots more attention than yet another glossy catalog. \"Most brochures end up in the garbage, but a computer diskette will at least arouse people's curiosity to take a look,\" says Jeff Einstein, president of Einstein Automation Solutions Inc., a New York company that puts ads on floppy disks.SO FAR, floppy disks are being tested mainly by marketers of automobiles and financial services, including Chase Manhattan Bank, GM's Chevrolet division and Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division. Equitable Life Assurance Society is developing a disk for its insurance agents to hand out, and Merrill Lynch & Co. is considering disks as a new method for selling brokerage services. \"Floppy disks reach only a small audience, but the people who work with computers are an excellent demographic target for us,\" says Mary Rudie, director of marketing services at Merrill Lynch. SoftAd Group, the Sausalito, Calif., firm that designed the Buick floppy disk, notes that about 75% of PC users are college graduates with a median household income of more than $45,000.\"Software certainly isn't the right medium for selling toothpaste,\" says Paula George, president of SoftAd. \"But it would work for electronic equipment like VCRs and other expensive products that involve a complex selling message.\"\n",

But investment bankers say Kemper is now a less attractive property, because of the collapse of Conseco's offer and because higher interest rates have hurt Kemper's earnings prospects.Analysts predict that any buyer that surfaces now would bid far less than Conseco's original $67-a-share, $2.7 billion, offer, or its recent proposal to lower its bid to $60 a share, or $2.4 billion.\"When Conseco does a deal, they are very, very thorough,\" said Joanne Morrissey, president of Firemark Group, a Parsippany, N.J., insurance-research firm. \"This doesn't bode well for Kemper.\" Conseco and Kemper consented to cancelling the original takeover agreement, a step that frees the two sides from any legal obligations. \"It became clear to both parties that the proposed merger, even under Conseco's revised terms, could not be completed,\" said David Mathis, Kemper chairman. \"Our board remains committed to the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders.\"General Electric Capital Corp., which once bid $60 a share for Kemper, is exploring another run at Kemper.

A Viking flotilla coming from Iceland under cover of volcanic ash?I was pondering this mystery while on the elliptical machine this week and watching Glenn Beck (I find he increases my heart rate), when I heard him inform his viewers that \"they\" -- President Obama and friends -- \"are creating a global governance structure.\" \"Social and ecological justice and all of this bullcrap,\" Beck told his viewers, \"is man's work for a global government.\" Beck -- who is second in popularity only to Sarah Palin among the type of Tea Party activists who hijacked the Maine GOP -- tossed out phrases such as \"global standards\" and \"global bank tax\" -- all part of a conspiracy by the \"global government people.\" He further provided the news that \"Jesus doesn't want a cap-and-trade system.\"\n",

      " Dollar drops in wake of surge by yen; Clinton disputes Fed's chief on rates. NEW YORK -- The dollar stumbled yesterday as the yen drew strength from the third steepest rise in Tokyo stock market history, fueled by optimism over passage of Japan's long-stalled political-reform package during the weekend.In addition, any hopes for a dollar recovery after Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said interest rates will rise eventually were immediately put to rest when President Clinton termed low interest rates \"critical\" to the U.S. economic recovery.Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7345 marks, down from 1.7425 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 108.70 yen, down from 110 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.5060, up from $1.4945.About midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 108.25 yen and at 1.7340 marks.The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rocketed 7.8% to a three-month high of 20,229.12, after Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, pushed through the compromise reform package on which he had staked his political career.\n",

      " Board of Contributors: Goose the Money Supply. When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.\n",

The change is a warning to free-traders: Guys, you'd better wake up. There's rebellion in the country, a justified revolt by workers who cannot understand why the economic recovery has produced so few new jobs.Edwards told the tale of a father coming home from his factory job to put his daughter to bed. \"He knows his night is over when he gives her a hug,\" Edwards said, speaking in Milwaukee Tuesday. \"But tonight . . . he'll be coming home to tell her that his factory is closing, that he's about to lose his job.\"It's worth hearing Edwards to understand the power of this issue. He's not telling an economic story. He's offering a morality tale about a decent American hammered by the system. \"It's not because he's done anything wrong,\" Edwards said. \"He's done what he's supposed to do, he's been responsible, he's worked hard, he's raised his family.\"Nor is the factory closing because the company decided to stop making its product. \"The problem is they're going to make it somewhere else,\" Edwards says. \"They're going to make it somewhere outside of his community, outside of his country.\"Why? \"They only care about profits, they have lobbyists everywhere and they own this White House.\" The people in charge, he says, \"don't hear the other America.

      " Stock Mutual-Fund Selling Slows --- Withdrawals Outpaced Investments in October By a Narrower $7.7 Billion. Investors were net sellers of stock mutual funds in October, even as the market rallied strongly in the month's latter half.Investment Company Institute data show stock mutual funds experienced net withdrawals of $7.7 billion, as new money added to stock accounts of $74.9 billion was overwhelmed by redemptions of $77.5 billion. An additional $5.1 billion was withdrawn from stock funds because of exchanges into other fund categories.October's net outflows were well under the $16 billion investors had withdrawn in September. During October, the stock market reversed its downward trend started during the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best month since January 1987, soaring 11%.But investors' skepticism over stocks persisted. Taxable bond funds continued to snare money, receiving net new cash of $7.8 billion. But the pace of the net sales slowed from September's $13.1 billion.Year-to-date through the end of October, taxable bond funds grabbed a net $109.6 billion, while stock funds have had $26.5 billion in net withdrawals. Among other types of funds, hybrid mutual funds, which invest in both stocks and bonds, reported net redemptions of $1 billion after net withdrawals of $650 million in September. Investors took out a net $1.5 billion from municipal-bond funds, a significant change from September, when they added $2.3 billion.\n",

      " Let the Blue Chips Fly, But Don't Kowtow to the Dow. Once again, itUas time to talk about the stock market. The reason, of course, is that last week Wall StreetUas most sacred icon, the Dow Jones industrial average, broke through yet another barrier, closing above 6000. This came less than 11 months after the market broke 5000, and less than 20 months after it broke 4000.Be still, my heart. For despite the hoopla surrounding this pseudo-event, there arc lessons here: some new, some old. The new one is that you snouiun t pay very muc attention to the Dow, which is a crummy measure of the stock market even though everyone uses it, including me. The old lesson is that you shouldnUat let any number ending in three zeros determine what you do, no matter what assorted pundits and experts tell you. After all, itUas your money, your life, your investment decisions.That said, a 6000 Dow raises the same questions people asked when the Dow hit 4000 and 5000. If you're not in the market, is it too late to join the fun? If youUare in, should you get out just in case the market has peaked? Will the next thousand-point mark the Dow hits be 7000 or 5000? No one knows, least of all those of us at Newsweek. WeUare the people who put a bear on the cover 2400 points ago.But hereUas some advice, anyway, before we move on to something more interestingUOwhy itUas wrong to deify the Dow. Point one: Yes, sooner or later the market will fall sharply, despite stocks having defied history and logic by rising almost continually since October 1990. Point two: For heavenUas sake, donUat chase hot stocks or hot mutual funds unless youUare prepared to lose your shirt. Trend-surfing is fun, but sooner or later, you miss the wave and get wiped. Point three: Please, please, please donUat take the Dow too seriously.If the Dow hadn't already been around for 100 years, no one would create it now. To be sure, very smart people tend the average and try to keep it up to date. Over the years they've modernized the Dow by leavening its portfolio of heavy industrials with such non-industrials as Coca-Cola Co., Walt Disney Co. and McDonaldUas Corp. Still, the averageUas built-in flaws make it subject to weird and random movements. And that brings us to the main and final point. The Dow can tell you which way the market is going, but it's a crude tool.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Index Technology Corp. will introduce tomorrow a product to help corporate software experts update old mainframe software programs, Richard Carpenter, chairman and chief executive officer, said.The product, XL/Recover, marks a move into a new area of the software-engineering field that Index helped pioneer. It will be available next week. Index, the nation's biggest maker of products for the computer-aided software-engineering market, known as CASE, has previously made software tools to improve the productivity of programmers writing new programs.In an interview, Mr. Carpenter said the XL/Recover software program, which will sell for $9,800 and runs on IBM-compatible personal computers, \"is a major thrust in our offerings for 1991.\" He declined to predict sales but said it will \"probably account for 10% to 25% of revenue\" in the future.Last year, Index earned $2.3 million, or 50 cents a share, on revenue of $38 million. During this year, Index has continued to grow rapidly, but earnings have declined. First-half net was $961,000, or 20 cents a share, down 21% from $1.2 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 39% to $24.4 million from $17.5 million.Mr. Carpenter declined to predict earnings for the current quarter or the rest of the year. \"This is continuing to be an investment year for Index.

      " An Appraisal: More Investors Pessimistic on Stocks But Some Positive Signs Still Cited. Despite growing ranks of those who doubt that the bull market will enjoy a second phase, some investment officers still are counting on an upturn, at least for some sectors of the market.For most investors, \"the pendulum has swung to pessimism\" because they think the economic recovery is more robust than had been expected, says Donald E. Carver, vice president of First Pennsylvania Corp., Philadelphia. They see exceptionally strong public and private credit demand and they fear the current economic strength will prompt the Federal Reserve \"to adopt a more restrictive credit policy that could abort the economic recovery,\" he asserts.Other negative factors, he adds, include reduced contributions to corporate pension funds and fewer stock purchases by foreigners.However, Mr. Carver believes these negatives are outweighed by positive developments. \"Although inflation is rising, it's still moderate, and commodity prices are weak,\" he contends. \"Federal expenditures are running well below budgeted levels and the deficit for the current fiscal year won't be as bad as had been feared.\" He notes that with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 15% from its record high last November, it is now at book value.In addition, Mr. Carver says that \"less stock is available because over $40 billion in takeovers and stock repurchase programs has shrunk the supply.\"\n",

      " A1 8 SATURDAY, APRIL 12, 1980  . THE PLAN for National Airport, now pending before Secretary of Transportation Neil Goldschmidt and FAA Administrator Langhorne Bond, is a .disaster. It would enshrine Dulles as the worldUas greatest secondary airfield and it would destroy the last trace of any hope that someday people will be able to live and work and walk along the Potomac River in comfort.Dulles was built, as those who have been around this city for 20 years will remember, to become WashingtonUas major UIjetport.U The decision to pour $120 millionUOin 1960 dollarsUOinto it was predicated on the belief that National Airport was too crowded, too noisy and too dangerous. Now, with National handling almost four times as many passengers as it did then, generating more noise and presenting equally serious safety problems, the planners are urging that it-become ever larger and that it remain this cityUas major airport indefinitely.The answer is that almost everyone has fallen into the .habit of believing that National is and must always be this communityUas major airport. We fell into th^e trap ourselves a few weeks ago when we described the plan for NationalUas future as not too bad UIas long asU that airport is to be No. 1.'ButUOas the National Capital Planning Commission asked yesterdayUOshould National continue to be WashingtonUas major airport? It is handling hundreds of planesUOjetsUOeach day for which it is too small. It isTcbping with a passenger load that would destroy most other airports. And it is a terrible neighbor to tens of thousands of people who live and work and play under its flight paths. No community that had control over its own destiny would have tolerated National during all these years when Dulles has stood in isolated splendor. National would haveUOshould have UOgone the way of the in-town airports in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City long ago.National has remained inviolate, however, because of the belief that air travelers, especially if they are members of Congress, have an inalienable right to fly into the middle of Washington. ThatUas why the first opportunity to make Dulles the major airportUOthe proposal to bar jets from NationalUOwas ignored for 15 years. ThatUas why the second opportunityUOputting a-500-mile limit on flights in and out of NationalUO was repudiated after the FAA seized it briefly. And thatUas why the current and probably last opportunity UOthe introduction of wide-bodied, small jetsUOis about to disappear. All the thinking of FAAUas planners concerns what to do with the passengers who will be UIturned awayU from National if limits are placed on its growth.\n",

If thatUas really the reason for the credit crunch, then a good many business borrowers will face a credit crunch after the recession ends.The future is now. in fact Strong character and past banking relationships notwithstanding, business borrowers will be held to stricter standards, having to prove up front that they have the wherewithal to repay. Like it or not that's a legacy of the unprecedented growth of the 1980s, which banks helped finance apparently with too few questions asked.Those who rail against the banks for creating the credit crunch had better get used to the idea, if they havenUat already, that the banking business just won't be the same after struggling through one of the worst slumps ever in the commercial real estate industry. Long after the recession is over, banks will likely be more conservative than ever in granting loans to buriness borrowers.For those who became so accustomed to informal banking relationships, in which lines of credit were more like slush funds for members of a social club, the handwriting is on the walL Not only have bankers been burned by liberal lending practices of the past, but regulators, reacting to the real estate recession, also have put the fear of the banking gods in loan officersUa hearts, insisting that loans be made by the book. As a result, banking relationships that many business borrowers enjoyed in the past have changed dramatically.UIThe process of granting credit in the Ua90s will be different,\" predicted William C.

      " After Gramm-Rudman, Look to Spending Cap. Whether or not the Supreme Court does what ABC News said it will do and strikes down a critical part of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we ought to be considering further changes in the federal budget process. The prospect of losing G-R-H only adds urgency, as the lead times for any new measures would be long.The proposals most discussed in this vein are a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a presidential line-item veto, or perhaps a \"son of G-R-H\": reconstituting it if the court finds its present provisions invalid.From the standpoint of sustaining long-term economic growth, none of these measures holds as much merit as requiring that the rate of growth in total federal spending should be no greater than the rate of growth of the gross national product. This rule would prevent the ratio of government spending to GNP from rising, as it characteristically has in the past.Two central facts provide support for focusing on total spending as opposed to budget balancing or piecemeal paring.First, a significant negative relationship exists between the rate of economic growth and the size of the government sector (as measured by government spending as a ratio to GNP, or by the tax take as a ratio to GNP). Depending on which measure of government size is used, as well as a number of other factors (for example, the particular countries and the time period considered), research done both at Rand and the World Bank suggests that for each increase of 1% in the size of government, long-term economic growth decreases between 0.1% and 0.6% annually in both developed and developing countries.\n",

      " The Washington Post Henry Kissinger  . Recent conversations with Chinese leaders have convinced me that the Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that has just opened in Beijing is likely to mark the rare example of a ruling group that voluntarily diminishes its dominant position. Of course the scope of government in a country of 1 billion population is comparable to nothing else. The majority of ChinaUas provinces each has a population larger than those of the most populous European states. Most of ChinaUas dynasties have each lasted longer than the entire history of the United States. China thus has a perspective all its own. About no other society would it be possible to repeat the apocryphal story of a Chinese leaderUas reply to the question of what he thought of the French Revolution: UIIt is too early to tell.\"The task of governing China is made all the more daunting by its peopleUas extraordinary mix of individualism and fierce sense of cultural uniqueness. Rulers have often despaired of achieving coherence by any means other than monolithic rule only to be submerged in the end by the elemental common sense of that multitude that defends its fundamental values by patient endurance. At the height of his power, when complimented by Nixon on having changed the face of China, Mao replied: UINo, I have only changed Beijing and a few of its environs.U I thought then he was being polite; I now know he was prophetic.Indeed MaoUas intuition of the ultimate futility of his doctrinal obsessions caused him to unleash the frenzy of the Cultural Revolution. But in the end the Chinese people outlasted the violent attempt to impose an unnatural conformity by destroying all ancient values. Ironically, the Cultural Revolution brought about the exact opposite of its intention: it guaranteed reform. Every contemporary Chinese leader has survived a decade of degradation, imprisonment and deprivation. Far from being broken by the ordeal, they emerged serenely determined to reform the system that made such suffering possible.This legacy is the principal reason to be optimistic about the poignant task Deng Xiaoping has set for himself: to abandon, at the end of his life as a revolutionary, his movementUas quest to bend reality to theory. Deng is fond of saying that he is neither a reformer nor a conservative, but someone UIwho has sought truth from facts.UThat truth as it will emerge at the party congress is likely to contradict almost every previous Communist practice elsewhere: it will reject detailed central planning; it will implement two principles that are revolutionary in Communist terms: that a Communist state can prosper only if the Communist Party abandons the detailed supervision of government and if the government loosens its grip over the economy.\n",

For only the second time in the past 12 months, actively managed stock funds finished the month ahead of funds pegged to one of the market's most widely followed indexes.After trailing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for most of the past year, actively managed funds weathered the recent tumult in the stock market better than index funds. And they did it largely by benefiting from many of the same factors that have hindered them in the past year.It may not be much to brag about, however, because actively managed funds actually just posted smaller losses than index funds. According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., domestic equity funds, excluding S&P 500 funds, posted an average loss of 1.65% between the end of July and Aug. 28. Index funds lost 5.19% on average. The S&P, meanwhile, dropped 5.17%.Gus Sauter, managing director at index-fund proponent Vanguard Group, acknowledges that the climate has changed in the stock market. \"The environment we've experienced over the last couple of months has made it a little easier for the active manager when compared to the S&P,\" says Mr. Sauter, who heads the index-fund group at Vanguard. \"It's not that it's a terrible story for the S&P, it's more that it's moved down to the middle of the pack.\"Using S&P 500 funds as a benchmark, \"passive funds have been one of the poorer investments over the past four weeks, instead of one of the better ones, as they had been for quite some time,\" says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Inc.\n",

NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. is pondering a move that would rankle the brokerage industry: the nation's largest securities firm is thinking of starting to offer its own \"index funds\" to small investors sometime next year.Merrill officials caution that the firm hasn't decided whether to take this course with index funds, which are structured to mirror the performance of popular stock-market benchmarks, such as the Standard & Poor's 500. Index funds, which simply try to match the market rather than beat it, run counter to the brokerage-firm thinking that fund investors crave active money management to protect their savings amid market slumps.But people with knowledge of Merrill's intentions say the big brokerage house's asset-management subsidiary, Merrill Lynch Asset Management, is considering the launch of several index-funds to its \"wrap-account\" customers in 1997. The possibility was described in a recent internal memo on how the asset-management unit can increase its business in the year ahead, people with knowledge of the move say.Brokerage-house wrap accounts are so called because all the fees are wrapped into one levy, typically 1% to 3% of assets every year. By charging such fees, a brokerage house might seem to be undermining a major draw for investors in index funds, namely, that their costs are extremely low. But there's no doubt that index funds have been much in demand recently. The nation's second-largest mutual-fund company, Vanguard Group of Valley Forge, Pa., has been selling index funds like hotcakes and beating a lot of the actively managed competition in performance this year.\"It represents a real sea change in the industry's attitude toward index products\" for Merrill even to consider such a move, says Burton Greenwald, a Philadelphia mutual-fund consultant. \"Everyone has been reluctant to push them. If Merrill Lynch, given its sheer size, will offer them, others are likely to follow.\"\n",

Rudman (R-N.H.), one of the most outspoken, influential and effective senators of the past decade, said yesterday he will not seek a third term this fall because of frustration over paralysis in government and his own powerlessness to do anything about it.\"Frankly, if I thought I could make a difference, I would have stayed, but I don't,\" said the irascible but well-liked New Englander, who, despite his frustrations, was credited by colleagues with having had more of an impact than many senators who have served far longer on Capitol Hill.Rudman, a 61-year-old lawyer, cited the stalemate over curbing budget deficits as his chief source of frustration and warned that the huge federal debt could undermine the nation's security in a few years.\"I will miss the people, not the frustration,\" Rudman added, reflecting a broad and deepening concern on the part of the most conscientious lawmakers on Capitol Hill about governmental gridlock, their inability to break it and the rage they are incurring from constituents as a result.Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who is seeking reelection this year, said many senators share Rudman's frustrations and \"a lot\" are considering quitting for the same reasons. \"We have been so polarized by single-issue groups, special-interest groups, lobbyists and the rest that it's not easy to get together and solve anything anymore . . . and it's not easy to contemplate continuing in this vein.\"\n",

      " The Doctor's In, the Stocks Aren't; Investing in the Changing Health Care Sector Isn't for the Squeamish. Investing in the U.S. health care industry nowadays is like surviving a mortar attack during an earthquake just as a typhoon hits. The competition is so brutal, the cost pressures so unforgiving and the regulatory atmosphere so unpredictable, nobody can fathom what's coming -- even if the stock market calms down.The first lesson, industry officials say, is that health care stocks don't rise and fall in tandem. Instead, there are dozens of sub-sectors with conflicting interests in the business of \"managed care\" -- the buzzword for insurers' attempts to limit health costs by controlling services.Investors seeking quick riches in health care \"had better think again,\" mutual fund research company Morningstar Inc. said in a February report. \"There is no longer a single, largely synchronized, health care industry. The emergence of managed care has not only changed medical care as Americans knew it, but also provided a minefield of investment opportunities.\"Take Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the biggest U.S. medical care firm. For years Wall Street rewarded the Nashville-based company, which barely caught its breath while snapping up 1,000 hospitals, clinics and home health providers across the nation. The firm's stock rose 350 percent in four years.The logic of Columbia's prosperity is inarguable, industry officials said. One of the biggest causes of medical inflation is the 40 percent vacancy rate for hospital beds, and Columbia solves it by buying numerous hospitals in a region, then shutting a couple. Columbia fills the bill for health insurers wanting to streamline operations by dealing with as few health care providers as possible.\n",

NOW VIRGINIA can truly call itself the \"Old Dominion.\" Famous for its legions of retired federal and military pensioners, Virginia looks to be America's next Sun City. Thanks to a bill signed last summer by Gov. George Allen, his state can lay claim to the nation's most senior-friendly tax policy.What's happening in Virginia should remind victorious Republicans that both political parties are responsible for the pandering to seniors that contributes mightily to America's fiscal crisis. It should also remind the Kerrey-Danforth \"Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform\" to pay due attention to the word \"tax\" as they prepare their report. In recent decades, all levels of government have given tax advantages to well-off seniors while ignoring the extra burden this age bias imposes on younger generations.Although many states, as well as the federal government, show favoritism to older people in their tax laws, Virginia's new law pushes this bias to a new extreme. The law offers no new benefits to seniors with incomes below the poverty line but gives handsome rewards to middle- and upper-income retirees. The bottom line is this: Every senior, no matter how rich, gets an extra $12,000 annual deduction on the state income tax form that young taxpayers don't - plus a total exclusion on social security income.This means that, starting in 1996, a retired 65-year-old couple on maximum social security (projected at $13,764 per retiree) will pay no state income tax on their first $59,728 of income - regardless of how the rest of their income is derived. A 62-year-old couple will pay nothing on the first $40,622 of income. But a 30-year-old couple with one child will pay tax on income above $7,400.To this new break, Fairfax County's seniors can also add the \"empty-nester\" total property tax forgiveness for middle-income seniors with incomes up to $40,000 and assets (excluding residence) of up to $150,000. Now add federal income and FICA taxes to the calculations, and look what happens in the following cases:\n",

      " Fifth Straight Rise Scored by Market: Holiday Influence. NEW YORK, Sept. 15 (AP)UOThe stock market recovery drive won a lot more credibility for itself among market technicians today as it stretched its string of advances to five straight. Trading was moderate. Volume was 6.15 million shares compared with 6.25 million yesterday.The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 8.07 points, or 1 per cent to 814.30, putting it further, above the psychologically important 800 level, which it vaulted so surprisingly on Wednesday.

      " Sober Steps Back to the Runway; After a Tough Year, the Do's and Taboos of Fashion Are Still Shifting. In a country filled with yellow and orange terrorism alerts, fears of biological and chemical attacks, and pronounced discomfort with Muslims, Islam and the Koran, it would seem that there are certain untouchable topics that fashion has no business exploring.In the days and months following last year's terrorist attacks, which put an end to fashion week here, the industry responded much like the rest of the country -- with anger, shock and bold strokes of patriotism. With a harsh gravitas woven into daily life, the industry questioned once-prosaic decisions about putting camouflage, artfully wrecked garments or aggressive images on the runway. Designers softened their fashion show soundtracks. Or used no music at all. There was a greater awareness of how even the most modest examples of frivolity might be perceived in a world racked by grief and fear.For reasons of sensitivity and practicality, the fashion industry scaled back subsequent runway presentations, deciding that it would be inappropriate to condone shoving crowds, sharp tongues and prancing models on a set worthy of a Vegas showgirl. Designer boutiques opened without fanfare instead of popping champagne corks. Parties were downscaled to dinners.At the time, those seemed like the correct decisions. The business of fashion would carry on, but the silliness of it, the pretensions, the hype would be packed away for later consumption. All that anyone really wanted was the solace of beauty.The spring 2003 New York runway presentations begin today. Now that a year has passed, questions of appropriateness are more difficult to answer. Many of the responses that struck just the right tone 12 months ago now seem like cliches or are clouded by ambivalence. A year ago, people were implored in one resounding voice to go shopping and prove that the terrorists could claim neither a cultural nor an economic victory. On the anniversary of the attacks, stores here shut down for several hours; some locked their doors for the entire day. Others stayed open continuously.\n",

      " Regulatory Capture 101; Impressionable journalists finally meet George Stigler.. The financial scandal du jour involves leaked audio recordings that purport to show that regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were soft on Goldman Sachs. Say it ain't so.The news is being treated as shocking by journalists who claim to be hard-headed students of financial markets. One especially impressionable columnist calls it \"a jaw-dropping story about Wall Street regulation.\" The real scandal here is the excessive faith that liberal journalists and politicians continue to put in financial regulation. The media pack is discovering regulatory capture--a mere 43 years after George Stigler published his landmark paper on the concept.The secret recordings were made by Carmen Segarra, who went to work as an examiner at the New York Fed in 2011 but was fired less than seven months later in 2012. She has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the regulator and says Fed officials sought to bury her claim that Goldman had no firm-wide policy on conflicts-of-interest. Goldman says it has had such policies for years, though on the same day Ms. Segarra's revelations were broadcast, the firm added new restrictions on employees trading for their own accounts.The New York Fed won against Ms. Segarra in district court, though the case is on appeal. The regulator also notes that Ms. Segarra \"demanded $7 million to settle her complaint.\" And last week New York Fed President William Dudley said, \"We are going to keep striving to improve, but I don't think anyone should question our motives or what we are trying to accomplish.\"On the recordings, regulators can be heard doing what regulators do--revealing the limits of their knowledge and demonstrating their reluctance to challenge the firms they regulate. At one point Fed officials suspect a Goldman deal with Banco Santander may have been \"legal but shady\" in the words of one regulator, and should have required Fed approval. But the regulators basically accept Goldman's explanations without a fight.\n",

      " Turning Point; Did America's great political divide begin 92 years ago?. Kevin Phillips once wrote that Americans achieve through presidential elections what in other countries it takes a revolution to accomplish. The noted intellectual provocateur was exaggerating, of course. But, on occasion, our quadrennial circuses do produce or certify durable shifts in power.Andrew Jackson's triumph in 1828 ushered in an age of mass parties based on the needs and prejudices of ordinary white voters. Lincoln's victory in 1860 led directly to the Civil War (so much for elections substituting for armed conflict). Lashed to the Depression, Herbert Hoover lost the election of 1932 more than Franklin Roosevelt won it. But FDR, backed by a new multi-ethnic coalition, went on to build the modern welfare-warfare state that governs us still.James Chace would include the contest of 1912 in that select group. The election, he writes, \"introduced a conflict between progressive idealism . . . and conservative values\" that raged through the rest of the 20th century and continues today. Obviously, President George W. Bush now waves the banner of the right; only a publisher's deadline kept the author from naming John Kerry the latest defender of the liberal alternative.To flesh out his claim, Chace offers a brisk, consistently entertaining narrative that is alive both to politics and personality. The four serious candidates in 1912 were all men of intellectual substance, able to debate the major question of the day: how to sustain economic growth without widening the gulf between the corporate rich and everyone else. Republican President William Howard Taft and Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs occupied the right and left poles. The incumbent feared that a true crackdown on the mighty trusts that ruled the marketplace would endanger prosperity; the radical wanted to abolish private capital altogether. Running on the Progressive ticket, Theodore Roosevelt favored strict regulation of big business; Democrat Woodrow Wilson argued that the state should break up monopolies, not just force them to behave responsibly.Taft was never comfortable on the stump and spent more time that fall playing golf than giving speeches. But the other three contenders were gifted orators who drew huge, adoring crowds. Chace describes Debs reaching out his long, bony arms to working-class audiences, urging them to \"tear up privilege by the roots, and consecrate the earth and all its fullness to the joy and service of all humanity.\" He recounts how Roosevelt delivered a spirited hour- long address minutes after a would-be assassin shot him in the chest. He captures Wilson's success at shedding his Ivy League hauteur to emerge as a strong advocate of the rights of labor and small business.\n",

      " D.C. School Board Wants $84 Million For Raises, but City May Not Comply. The D.C. Board of Education, heading for another showdown with the D.C. Council during this year's fiscal crisis, is asking for an additional $84 million for pay raises it promised its teachers and other employees.The D.C. Council is unlikely to approve the school board's supplemental budget request, according to some council members and staffers, which means that the city's estimated 12,000 teachers and other school employees are unlikely to get pay raises negotiated last year.The school board decided Dec. 11 that it would send two budget requests to the council and mayor: The main budget, a $513.5 million proposal that Superintendent Franklin L. Smith described as a \"hold- the-line\" effort, and a supplemental budget that included an unspecified amount for pay raises.At that meeting, several members asked school board President R. David Hall (Ward 2) how much money they were voting on in the supplemental budget. He told them that an exact figure had not been set but that it would be at least $20 million. Every board member then voted for it.On Dec. 22, Hall sent a letter to Council Chairman John A. Wilson (D) and Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly stating that the supplemental amount was $84 million, about a 16 percent increase in the $513.5 million budget. The new figure was not announced publicly.\n",

The Wall Street consensus estimate was for a first-quarter loss of 30 cents a share.Core transaction revenues, mainly stock commissions, increased 60% from last year and 40% from the last, sequential quarter as investors clamored for hot Internet stocks and other technology issues. \"It's existing customers trading more . . . coupled with new customers coming online faster,\" E*Trade Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said.But the flurry of trades couldn't make up for the $41 million E*Trade poured into marketing to promote its new Web site, analysts said.

      " Wall Street Revives Reward Junkets for Top Brokers; Return Reflects Bullish Market, Competition for Revenue Producers. In late April, a few hundred of Morgan Stanley's top stockbrokers and their spouses jetted off to Hawaii for a gathering spiced with golf, deep-sea fishing and suntanning.When they arrived at the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua, on Maui, the first perks of their all-expenses-paid trip were waiting for them: \"pillow gifts\" of GoPro cameras and Maui Jim sunglasses, according to one attendee.With the stock market at record levels and wealth-management fees rising, Wall Street is reviving posh \"recognition'' junkets that were abruptly suspended in the 2008-2009 financial meltdown, when banks taking government bailouts wanted to avoid the appearance of extravagance. Morgan Stanley's Hawaii gathering was its most lavish since the crisis and its first outside of the continental U.S., according to advisers.Industry executives and analysts say the return of the junket reflects the bullish market and growing competition for top revenue-producing brokers, who, in addition to high pay, expect significant rewards for their efforts. Still, trips aren't as costly as those in precrisis days, and many now include work-related education and training.\"Prerecession, those trips were nothing but fun, but those are never coming back,\" said Steven Dudash, a financial adviser and president of IHT Wealth Management in Chicago, who has been in the industry for 15 years and recently left a job at Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch. \"I understand why in the public eye it would be frowned upon.\"\n",

      " The Decisions at Vail. Through two arduous days of economy-energy discussions at President FordUas ski chalet in Vail, Colo., it became obvious that Secretary of the Treasury William Simon had lost his long fight for a restrictive, anti-iniia-tionary budget in the face of recession.Although no decision was announced byjMr. Ford, even SimonUas lieutenants cohcede he is the loser of a year-long strugle with lame-duck Budget Director Roy Ash. The President will support not only income tax cuts but high federal spending to stimulate business. Injuring a colossal budget deficit that could surpass $40 billion.Both to recoup part of that loss and to conserve energy, Mr. Ford last weekend definitely approved a new excise tax on oil imports. That is part of an overall energy package, approved at Vail, to reduce consumption and increase production while abandoning the old Nixon-Ford concept of solving the energy crisis by voluntary action.13his, dressed in ski sweaters in the luxurious winter resort, the President and his top officials on Dec. 27 and 28 buried economy-energy policies of Mr. FordUas first five months and their Nixon roots. In incongruous surroundings, Mr. Ford belatedly changed economic direction at a time when public confidence was falling quickly.The most basic debate came Saturday morning, beginning the second day of meetings. Simon made his last pitch for budget restraint. While advocating anti-recessionary tax cuts, the Secretary of the Treasury warned that federal spending must be checked to prevent perpetual inflation. Indeed, Simon has hoped tax cuts would permit reducing both federal spending and the government itself.\n",

      " Must We Save for Our Grandchildren?. According to conventional wisdom among economists and policy makers, Americans do not save enough. The suggested remedies include tax incentives for saving and policies ensuring that government programs, such as Social Security, do not discourage saving. But Americans save more than many believe, and in any case, future generations will be better off than the current ones even if saving does not increase.It is true that by official measures, U.S. net national saving has been low, by both historical and international standards. For a decade at least, the high measured saving rates in Japan were cited to explain why Japanese economic growth was so much greater than the U.S.'s. Japan still has a higher saving rate, but its growth has stopped. Most developed economies would be envious of the U.S.'s 4% economic growth rate and its unemployment rate of less than 5%. It seems a bad bargain to change places with Japan, or any of the other nations with purportedly higher saving rates.But by appropriate measures, the U.S. saving rate is not really so low. The official measure of net national saving begins with gross saving, which has been rising. Gross saving reached 17.3% of gross domestic product in 1997. To calculate the net saving, usually viewed as national saving, one must subtract depreciation or \"consumption of fixed capital.\" This brings the rate of net national saving down to $555 billion, or 6.5% of GDP. That $555 billion would add about 2.8% to the current net stock of tangible capital, public and private. Thus it implies a growth in capital somewhat higher than commonly forecast long-run growth rate of the economy.Even this net rate might not be an adequate measure of growth in a period of rapid technological advance. The depreciated capital might be replaced by more productive new capital, so that even without adding to the measure of net capital stock the capacity for growth would increase. A better perspective could be gained by looking at real gross domestic investment, private and public. That total, financed in part by foreign net investment equal to 2% of our GDP, comes to 19.5% of GDP.This higher real percentage reflects the falling price of much investment, particularly in computers; relatively more investment goods than consumption goods are being bought for each dollar. The net real domestic investment of $592 billion (1992 dollars) in 1997 was thus 8.2% of real GDP, suggesting that real capital stock was growing even more rapidly relative to real output.\n",

      " Tighter Credit Unlikely To Choke Off Expansion. The recent turmoil on Wall Street reflects the simple fact that interest rates are rising rather than falling for the first time in nearly a decade, forcing speculators and investors to recalibrate the assumptions onBut the consensus among economists is that the rise in rates will not choke off the current expansion because1 the economy is strong enough to overcome it.\"IkTear term, these higher interest rates and market gyrations are scary for everyone,U said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. UIBut in point of fact, the amount of damage to the economy should not be great.UUIThe rate of growth in the economy is determined by a number of factors, including incomes, exports, jobs,U said Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. \"And right now those factors are providing the econo-, my with enough momentum.\" This calm in the face of rising rates may seem somewhat at odds with recent economic history. Last year, after all, falling interest rates were widely credited with getting the economy out of low gear. WouldnUat a rise in rates now have the opposite effect?Not exactly, say economists.

TiVo Inc. said it received an important patent associated with disc-based video recorders but also announced a fiscal first-quarter net loss that more than doubled from a year earlier.Analysts said the patent boosts the prospects for TiVo to get additional revenue from licensing its technologies. TiVo said it already has a licensing agreement with the original equipment makers that manufacture its recorders. But with the patent, it has the right to license its technologies to cable providers, competitors and other companies. In response, TiVo's shares rose $3.56, or 72%, to $8.50 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.Personal video recorders such as TiVo's record TV programming work in a way that, among other things, let users effectively pause live broadcasts or skip over commercials.The Alviso, Calif., company said the patent covers many of the inventions associated with the devices, including a method for recording a TV program while playing back another or watching a program as it is being recorded; a method for processing various multimedia streams such as video and audio at low cost; and a storage format that allows users to pause and scan through a live TV broadcast.TiVo could use a boost.

      " Hamiltonian Democrats. It's come to this: The chief project to restate Democratic economics for our time was unveiled a couple of weeks ago, and it's named after the father of American conservatism, Alexander Hamilton.Necessarily, the authors of the Hamilton Project preface their declaration with an attempt, not altogether successful, to reclaim Hamilton from the right. The nation's first secretary of the Treasury, they note, \"stood for sound fiscal policy, believed that broad-based opportunity for advancement would drive American economic growth, and recognized that 'prudent aids and encouragements on the part of government' are necessary to enhance and guide market forces.\"Which is true, as far as it goes. Hamilton believed in balanced budgets and in the government's taking an active role to build the infrastructure and fiscal climate that business and the nation need to succeed -- ideas as alien to the current administration as support for collective farms. But Hamilton also feared the common people, dismissed their capacity for self-government and supported rule by elites instead.That might be enough to deter most Democrats from naming their firstborn economic revitalization scheme after him, but the authors of the Hamilton Project are made of sterner stuff. They include Peter Orszag, an estimable Brookings Institution economist; investment banker Roger Altman, formerly of the Clinton Treasury department; and, chiefly, former Treasury secretary and current Citigroup executive committee Chairman Robert Rubin, whose iconic status within the Democratic mainstream has waxed as the median incomes of Americans under the Bush presidency have waned. Rubin has also become a seal of good housekeeping for Democratic candidates seeking money from Wall Street. When Bob Rubin talks, Democratic pols don't just listen; they scramble for front-row seats and make a show of taking notes.Much of what Rubin and his co-authors have to say in their statement is on the money. Since the mid-'70s, they note, \"prosperity has neither trickled down nor rippled outward.\" They acknowledge that recapturing broadly shared prosperity in an age of globalization is a daunting conundrum. Still, they have some recommendations: Balance the budget (a principle they elevate to a fetish). Have the government invest more in \"education, health care, energy independence, scientific research, and infrastructure,\" since market forces \"will not generate adequate investments\" in such social essentials. Provide compensatory wage insurance for the many workers forced to take lower-paying jobs as middle-income jobs grow scarcer.\n",

The number of children eligible for free or reduced lunch is up 50%. A little more than a year ago, the Methodist church began seminars for marriages strained by job losses.Roswell is a pre-Civil War cotton mill town that grew into a wealthy bedroom community of Atlanta as the metro area prospered. More than half the city's 88,000 residents have four-year college degrees. But Roswell sits in a region with an unusually severe case of long-term unemployment: About 40% of the unemployed in the Atlanta metro area in 2010, the most recent local data available, were out of work for a year or more versus the national average of 29%.One of them is Marcy Bronner, 57 years old. When she lost her job at Pennzoil back in 2000, it took her seven months to find a new one at Quintiles, a bio- and pharmaceutical-services company. She eventually became senior director of human resources at a salary in the low six figures.In November 2010, she was laid off again. More than a year later, she is still looking for work. \"It's harder now,\" she says, compared to the 2000s. \"There's a lot more people out there.\"While the job market is improving -- the national unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in December -- long-term unemployment continues to be particularly pronounced, and there is little indication that it is falling quickly.

After just three months, productivity had quadrupled, to about six pairs of shoes per day for each employee from Long March's old level of 1.5 pairs.By the end of the decade, Shaffer had expanded his operations to three factories here, and was making up to 650,000 pairs of shoes a month for such U.S. companies as Timberland, Thom McAn and Stride Rite - and for his old employer, Nike. His sales in 1990 totaled $74 million.

While there is some speculation that the current sour mood may swell the ranks of protest voters on Tuesday, many political scientists think Belmont's reaction will be more typical.\"My guess is that voters will treat their disgust with politicians as a further excuse not to participate,\" said Benjamin Barber, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. \"It becomes a rationalization for disempowerment.

      " Bears' View: Bulls' Time Is Dwindling --- As Stocks Ride High, They Say Speculation Is Driving the Market. The stock market cooled a bit late last week from its record-breaking pace, but more and more investors seem to be piling onto the bull's bandwagon.Euphoria aside, Wall Street clearly is banking on a U.S. economic recovery to justify current stock prices. The bulls argue that the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates low enough to spin the economy out of its recession rut. Buying stocks now, the bulls calculate, will produce big rewards later when rebounding economic activity sends corporate profits soaring.That optimistic outlook is so pervasive, says Ned Davis, a market researcher, that signs of rampaging bullishness abound: Cash levels at \"aggressive growth\" mutual funds have fallen sharply as portfolio managers scoop up stocks. A poll by the American Association of Individual Investors shows a 3-to-1 ratio of bullish to bearish sentiment, the highest level of public optimism since 1987. And odd-lot trading, the old-fashioned gauge of \"little guys\" interest in stocks, is at \"the highest relative level of buying for something like the last 12 years,\" Mr. Davis says.This is a hostile environment for bears, and one wonders if any can survive at altitudes above Dow 3000?

      " Did FDR End the Depression?. 'He got us out of the Great Depression.\" That's probably the most frequent comment made about President Franklin Roosevelt, who died 65 years ago today. Every Democratic president from Truman to Obama has believed it, and each has used FDR's New Deal as a model for expanding the government.It's a myth. FDR did not get us out of the Great Depression -- not during the 1930s, and only in a limited sense during World War II.Let's start with the New Deal. Its various alphabet-soup agencies -- the WPA, AAA, NRA and even the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) -- failed to create sustainable jobs. In May 1939, U.S. unemployment still exceeded 20%. European countries, according to a League of Nations survey, averaged only about 12% in 1938. The New Deal, by forcing taxes up and discouraging entrepreneurs from investing, probably did more harm than good.What about World War II? We need to understand that the near-full employment during the conflict was temporary. Ten million to 12 million soldiers overseas and another 10 million to 15 million people making tanks, bullets and war materiel do not a lasting recovery make. The country essentially traded temporary jobs for a skyrocketing national debt. Many of those jobs had little or no value after the war.No one knew this more than FDR himself. His key advisers were frantic at the possibility of the Great Depression's return when the war ended and the soldiers came home. The president believed a New Deal revival was the answer -- and on Oct. 28, 1944, about six months before his death, he spelled out his vision for a postwar America. It included government-subsidized housing, federal involvement in health care, more TVA projects, and the \"right to a useful and remunerative job\" provided by the federal government if necessary.\n",

      " Movie Industry Set a Record in 1988 With Firm Boost From Christmas Films. NEW YORK -- The movie industry is off to a strong start for 1989, thanks to the continuing box office draw of a number of Christmas movies that helped boost 1988 revenue 3.5%, to a record $4.4 billion.But industry analysts differ over how long the current crop of movies will draw patrons, and they question whether the industry can sustain the annual increases that have brought box office revenue to record highs in each of the past few years. A.D. Murphy, who compiled the box office data for Variety, the show business newspaper, for example, said the industry's prosperity may be \"peaking\" and that the industry may be about to enter another recession.Walt Disney Co., as expected, emerged as the industry's market share leader, with 19.5% of the 1988 revenue, even though the studio didn't have a huge Christmas hit. Gulf & Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit was the box office leader at Christmas with \"Scrooged\" and \"The Naked Gun.\" But because of a less impressive release schedule earlier in the year, Paramount came in No. 2 for 1988 with a 15.2% share of box office revenue.Fewer pictures were released in the 1988 holiday season than in most previous years, and so far, none of the holiday releases has emerged as a potential $100 million-plus blockbuster. But a number of movies, as expected, sold between $25 million and $55 million in tickets. And, said Mr. Murphy, \"The holiday season was just great, considering that both Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Saturday night.\"Some industry analysts said a number of films released around Christmas appear likely to continue to draw moviegoers for at least another month, including MGM/UA Communications Co.'s \"Rain Man\" and MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios' \"Twins.\" \"Rain Man,\" which stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise, sold more than $42 million of tickets in just three weeks of release; \"Twins\" sold more than $55 million in about four weeks.\n",

      " Tokyo equities bruised by Japanese rate fears; steady U.S. rates spur some bourses to records. TOKYO -- Japan's stock market slid 2.4% Wednesday, ignoring what should have been good news -- a weaker yen -- and focusing instead on fears that the Bank of Japan may soon increase interest rates.The Nikkei 225-stock index lost 490.85 points to 19841.98. That followed a 156.92-month. In trading Thursday, the Nikkei fell 138.61 points to close the morning session at 19703.37. Wednesday's first-section volume was estimated at 430 million shares, down from 437.3 million shares Tuesday. Losers overwhelmed gainers, 886-245. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first-section issues tumbled 27.57 points, or 1.8%, to 1475.99.Stocks dropped even as the dollar rose to 114.35 yen in late Tokyo trading from 112.55 a day earlier. Normally, a drop in the yen is good news for Japanese stocks, because if that weakness persists, it can make Japanese goods less expensive in dollar terms overseas. Investors are keen to see a slightly weaker yen these days, after its surge against the dollar; only three weeks ago, the dollar traded at 127.37 yen.But Tokyo investors Wednesday were paying more attention to rumors that Japanese interest rates might soon risesomething that could hurt Japanese stocks by attracting money into fixed-income instruments and by raising borrowing costs for Japanese companies. The banking sector lost 2.1% to foreign selling. Securities firms shed 1.9%.A Japanese news report Tuesday said Toshihiko Fukui, vice governor of Japan's central bank, was \"not uncomfortable\" with a suggestion by Japan's trade unions that interest rates should rise. Stocks fell on the report, despite the announcement by the Bank of Japan later in the day that Mr. Fukui had merely shown \"understanding\" for the request, while emphasizing the need for a cautious approach.\n",

      " Investors Ignore Gloom, Keep On Buying --- They Fear Missing Rise, Manager Says. Investors may be talking bearish, but they're still walking bullish.During the past two months, the level of negative sentiment -- at least as articulated by the assorted seers and chin-scratchers on Wall Street -- has grown noticeably. Strategists bullish throughout 1995's impressive stock market run have grown increasingly skittish about the market's prospects for the rest of this year. Among the reasons bearishness is so in vogue: speculative movement among small stocks and an overly aggressive investor lust for initial public offerings of any kind.But at the same time, even as the talk grows more pessimistic, the folks with the hard cash continue to remain, well, fairly bullish. Mutual fund cash inflows are powerfully strong. Cash levels among institutional investors are stuck at aggressively low levels. Money managers, while nervously talking about rising interest rates and stretched valuations, continue to deploy new assets into the stock market. And analysts' estimates for 1996 earnings for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index companies have risen in four of the past five weeks, according to I/B/E/S International Inc., a research firm in New York.\"People are talking a lot about being more nervous, but I sure don't see it reflected in the stock prices,\" says Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. \"Part of the problem is that people are afraid of being out of the market. Though investors are talking more pessimistically, the one thing we've learned during the past year and a half is that being in cash is not the place to be.\"Yes, holding cash can be deadly, which might explain why it's easier to try to call a market top than it is to move investments to reflect such sentiment. Jeffrey Vinik, late of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, learned the hard way that playing defense in this market can be immensely unrewarding. And many of the most outspoken and nervous bears concede that they have felt nervous and bearish for a long time.\n",

      " THE PACIFIC. The Clinton bandwagon may not make it north of the Arctic Circle, where Republicans appear to have insulated themselves from forces prevailing in the Lower 48. Sen. Ted Stevens (R), who would chair Appropriations if the GOP keeps its majority, is breezing to a fifth term over former Anchorage school board member Theresa Obermeyer (D).They brought the GOP convention to San Diego, they followed Gov. Pete Wilson's prescription to pound away on crime, immigration and affirmative action, they campaigned the state long and hard, but Dole and Kemp have not been able to shake Clinton's grip on this richest electoral prize. Clinton has benefited from an economic recovery that -- in California at least -- was not visible before he became president, a cultural affinity for Hollywood and the pleasure-seekers up and down the coast, and four years of careful ministration to California needs, whether it be earthquake relief or a bailout of a flat-broke hospital system. Two public polls last week put Clinton 12 to 18 points up and he was confident enough of having put it away that he cut short his final swing to work in other states.A dozen House seats are in play, slightly more of them Republican, but in the end there may be few changes. Most prominent on the endangered species list is 16-term Rep. George Brown (D), a perennial target who this year faces an even tougher opponent in Superior Court Judge Linda Wilde (R). Brown, 76, did not help his chances when he remarked in a debate on education: \"I imagine Linda, because she is a lady, is afraid of math.\" He is still trying to dig himself out of that one.Two other Democrats have serious challenges from the same opponents who came close to defeating them in 1994. Rep. Jane Harman (D) was taken into a recount by Susan Brooks (R), a local government official in Rancho Palos Verdes. Harman has a limitless bank account and is probably strong enough to stave off Brooks again. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio is in a rematch with real estate broker Tim LeFever (R), who came within 7,000 votes last time. LeFever was one of the Republicans who used an ad on the death penalty in which he morphed his opponent's face into that of Richard Allen Davis, murderer of Polly Klaas.Rep. Cal Dooley (D), who represents a conservative district near Bakersfield, always has a battle, this time with Assemblyman Trice Harvey (R).\n",

      " To Fuel a Rebirth, Rural Va. County Looked Inward; Focus on Retaining Firms Pays. Joe Ellis first realized that hard times were coming to his native Blue Ridge community a decade ago when a local pajama factory packed up after 50 years and moved overseas, taking 1,100 jobs.In 2001, the Natalie Knitting factory, which had been around as long as anyone could remember, pulled up stakes, taking its 350 jobs. Not far behind was the Buster Brown plant and 300 jobs.\"It was a constant downward spiral for the entire community,\" said Ellis, who grew up outside this mountain town of 6,300, about 330 miles southwest of Washington.The towns of Smyth County -- Marion, Chilhowie and Saltville - - were being \"dealt away,\" in local parlance. In the new global economy, the textile and manufacturing plants that had helped Smyth County thrive 30 years ago were headed where labor was cheaper.Now he and a group of local officials and economic leaders are determined to give Smyth County an economic transfusion. Along with keeping his company and its 40 workers humming, Ellis has invested in increasing the region's tourist trade while county leaders have concentrated on keeping the county's remaining businesses and luring more. They've done so with tax incentives and efforts to improve education for the labor force. So far the tactics have worked so well that state leaders call Smyth County a model.\n",

      " Recovery at Philips Electronics Stalls Amid Crises, U.S. Setback. Philips Electronics NV's two-year financial recovery ground to a halt as the company reported an 853 million guilder ($437 million) operating loss for the fourth quarter.The economic crisis in Asia and parts of Latin America, as well as a costly fiasco in the U.S. mobile phone market, took a big toll on Philips's results, reversing a 1.16 billion guilder operating profit in the yearearlier quarter. The loss partly reflects two billion guilders in charges and provisions taken to cover such problems.Reflecting the difficult market conditions, sales fell 6% to 19 billion guilders from 20.3 billion guilders. Net income, however, jumped to 10.32 billion guilders from 2.67 billion guilders, buoyed by onetime gains largely related to the sale of Philips's 75% stake in PolyGram NV to Canada's Seagram Co.Philips warned that it expects to report lower earnings during the first two quarters of this year, while a possible recovery would have to wait until the second half of the year. Philips will \"return to double-digit growth of earnings per share\" in 1999, Chief Executive Officer Cor Boonstra vowed at a news conference in Amsterdam.Analysts said Philips still has plenty of upside potential left. While its entry into the mobile phone market proved disastrous, the company has gained consumer electronics market share in Asia, bolstered its brand name in the U.S., expanded a highly succesful semiconductor business and bolstered its balance sheet by disposing of noncore businesses such as PolyGram.\n",

Adelphia Communications Corp.'s woes continued to mount as the cable concern disclosed it overstated revenue and cash flow by about $500 million over the past two years. Two of the company's newest board members resigned over the \"ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing\" at Adelphia.The news comes as Adelphia moves closer to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, something many analysts expect to happen by the end of next week, given Adelphia's cash constraints and a looming $50 million interest payment it must make by Saturday.Adelphia has begun discussions with banks about potential bankruptcy financing of as much as $1 billion or more, which would allow the company to continue operating under bankruptcy protection, according to people familiar with the matter.In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia provided some results from its own internal review launched several weeks ago after it was disclosed that the founding Rigas family had benefited from more than $3 billion in loans from the company.In its filing, Adelphia blamed former management, which included the Rigas family. The company said that current management believes information provided by prior management, including the amount of the company's cable system that has been rebuilt, \"was unreliable\" and said Adelphia plans to \"correct the information, where material, as current management develops information it considers reliable.\"\n",

      " Hauling Labor Law Into the Next Century; White House Report Likely to Start Bitter, Lengthy Fight Over Updating '30s-Era Reforms. A special White House commission issued a report on labor relations yesterday that the Clinton administration will use to try to update labor laws so that they fit the diverse work force of the 1990s.The fact-finding report by the 10-member Commission for the Future of Worker/Management Relations will serve as the starting point for what promises to be a bitter and lengthy legislative fight over reforming labor laws that date back to the Great Depression.Unlike the U.S. work force of the past six decades, the report said today's workers are \"more educated; more female, often part of a two-earner family; more likely to be members of a minority group; and getting older as the baby boomers age.\" This, it said, \"poses challenges to the traditional modes of compensation and organization of work schedules and makes provisions of equal opportunity for all increasingly critical to our economic success.\"Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called the report \"an attempt to begin the process of dialogue.\" Reich said the question that has to be answered is whether the current system of laws governing the workplace is \"appropriate to the times...\"The American workplace has undergone extraordinary transformation over the last six decades and will be evolving still more dramatically in the future,\" he said. \"But our legal framework and many of our notions about worker-management relations were made for a 1930s world - not the 21st century.\"\n",

      " Hope for Health Care?; HHS's Leavitt Sees an Opportunity in New Orleans. On Tuesday afternoon Mike Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, made another of his frequent trips to New Orleans on a mission that speaks volumes about his approach to what is arguably the most important domestic policy job in the federal government.In an interview hours before his departure, the former Utah governor told me that his purpose was to exchange ideas with local officials about how to make the hurricane-stricken city \"a model of a new design for delivering health care in this country.\"The urgency of the task -- not just for New Orleans but for the nation -- was underlined by a report that the journal Health Affairs issued as he left Washington. Its key finding: Health care, which now consumes 16 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product each year, will eat up 20 percent by 2015 -- a level that Leavitt said is \"unsustainable without serious damage to our economy.\"Steps such as the health savings accounts that President Bush has recommended, and others being discussed in Congress, can nibble at the problem, Leavitt says, but far more fundamental changes must be made if costs are to be brought under control without sacrificing quality care.Leavitt is attacking the problem at two levels. At the top, he has assigned his department the task of developing, by the end of this year, national standards for four \"breakthrough projects\" applying 21st-century information technology to medical offices and hospitals. One would standardize systems for registering patients and listing their prescriptions and other basic medical data so they would not have to be entered on separate clipboards with each visit. A second would set standards for equipment allowing remote monitoring of chronic illnesses, such as the blood sugar tests required by diabetes patients.\n",

That halted a streak of seven straight gains by the Nasdaq Composite Index.Blue-chip issues such as Microsoft lost 5 15/16 to 104, while Intel, coming off a 52-week high Tuesday, declined 4 3/16 to 104 5/8 (both on the Nasdaq Stock Market), and Motorola declined 6 13/16 to 153 9/16.Meanwhile, several of the momentum-driven high-tech issues that had persisted in the face of a broad decline in recent sessions got caught in the sell-off.

PRAGUE -- For the second day in a row, a top International Monetary Fund official put public pressure on the world's big economies to intervene to support the plunging euro, but there were no signs that the U.S. is prepared to join such an effort.Calling the euro \"heavily undervalued,\" the IMF's new managing director, Horst Koehler, told reporters it is clear \"that intervention cannot be taboo, because it is part of the instruments any central bank or government has available.\" The day before, the IMF's chief economist, Michael Mussa, said the conditions ripe for coordinated intervention are rare and added, \"One has to ask, `If not now, when?' \"The unusually blunt comments from the IMF officials sparked speculation in financial markets that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven big industrialized nations, who are to meet here Saturday, may be preparing to step up the rhetoric about the euro or agree on joint intervention.But the common currency fell to a new intraday low against the dollar of 84.38 cents, suggesting the markets weren't counting on intervention. The euro, born at $1.17 in January 1999, was trading late yesterday in New York at 84.83 cents, down from 85.09 cents Tuesday.The conventional wisdom about currency-market intervention, particularly among U.S. officials, is that it is most likely to succeed when it is coordinated among big economies, announced publicly and catches the markets by surprise. Although G-7 officials appear to agree that the euro is oversold, and by implication that the dollar is unsustainably high, widespread expectations about intervention offer an argument to delay rather than to act now.\n",

Funds that invest in a broad array of stocks gained a hefty 9.6 percent in the third quarter, thanks to a summer market rally that sent stock prices to record highs.But bond and fixed-income funds barely broke even, hurt by a slide in the junk bond market and by rising interest rates, which depressed bond prices generally.Among stock funds, the star performers were health and biotechnology funds, which rose 16.7 percent, chiefly on the popularity of medical service stocks.

      " REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Budget Cutting Made Easy. Congress finally has figured out a way to cut the federal deficit. It's called paralysis. As long as Congress fails to boost the federal debt ceiling it will have the best of all possible worlds. It can appropriate funds to its heart's content, to subsidize farmers, Amtrak riders, subway builders, merchant seamen, doctors, lawyers, beggarmen, chiefs. But if the president can't borrow, he can spend only what the government takes in. So, in a process called \"deferral\" he simply tells a lot of constituencies, \"We'll send you the money when we get it.\"Compared with what we've had, it's not a bad way to run the government. In the process of deferring, the president must make economic choices, deciding, for example, whether it is more important to build a shopping center in Des Moines or protect the U.S. from nuclear attack. Any process that forces such choices represents progress -- a kind of shotgun item veto.Congress has demonstrated once again this year that it cannot make economic choices on its own. The separate House and Senate \"deficit-reduction\" bills to be reconciled this week were properly described to the Associated Press by an anonymous OMB official as mostly phony, except of course for the new taxes. Appropriations bills currently under consideration by the two bodies, for agriculture, transportation, labor, health and education, are billions of dollars over budget. In forecasting federal spending, it is appropriations bills, not budget resolutions, that count.So what \"deficit reduction\" really distills down to is an effort to wangle some new taxes. The Senate wants to introduce the equivalent of a European-style value added (VAT) tax into the American tax system, under the guise of a special levy to clean up \"toxic wastes.\" It also wants to add a new import duty to finance \"worker retraining\" in the U.S.; since there has never been a huge demand for retraining under existing programs, it must be assumed that the main objectives are revenues and a little discreet protectionism.As always, revenue enhancers have some guileful arguments. They say, for example, that just-released budget figures for fiscal 1985 demonstrate that the federal deficit expanded even in a time of economic recovery. The deficit did expand, to $211.9 billion from $185.3 billion the preceding year, and even though the recovery slowed sharply this year there was indeed a recovery of sorts.\n",

But yesterday, it was taken as a sign of the market's resilience, reflecting how much market psychology has changed in the past year.Last summer, that kind of news would have tanked the market, traders said. \"IBM obviously was negative news and the market fought it off,\" said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at New York brokerage firm SG Cowen. \"We have had a lot of other accounting scandals crush the market, but this time people said it was isolated at IBM.\"Investors were buoyed by another cautiously optimistic comment on the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, which fueled hopes that the Fed will hold interest rates down to push the economy ahead. Some analysts think the Fed will cut its target short-term interest rates at its policy meeting later this month and could buy back bonds in the open market to prevent bond yields from rising. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped in price and its yield, which falls when the price rises, hit 3.333%, virtually back to the 45-year low of 3.326% set last month.The Nasdaq Composite Index, which doesn't include IBM but includes most other tech stocks, pushed through the 1600 mark to its highest close in more than a year, rising 0.81%, or 12.81 points, to 1603.56.

      " Breakaway (A Special Report) --- Technology: Using Office Design to Help Boost Productivity. John Vernon thinks of it as his Captain Kirk moment.The president of consulting firm Approach Inc. stood in front of the six-pack of cubicles outside his office one day and realized that \"office space is the final frontier\" for boosting productivity. His vision: a sleek space allowing his information-technology consulting teams to serve clients at warp speed. His company's office in Valhalla, N.Y., had more in common with the cube farms of Dilbert cartoon fame.\"The offices were on the exterior of the floor, and I had the corner office, of course, because I was the president,\" the 38-year-old Texas native says sheepishly. \"Everybody else was in a cubicle.\" If his firm of 60 employees was going to keep increasing revenue at more than 50% a year, he decided, the space needed to reflect the way his company actually did business.Fast-forward two years to today. Poorly designed cubicles and window-hogging offices are history. In their place is a work space defined by vertical black-metal supports and clusters of glass-walled conference rooms, desktops with low-rise dividers and tables. Laptops and flat-panel computer screens are scattered across work surfaces, which can be quickly reconfigured. Copiers and such are a few steps away, not down the hall and take the second right.\"People used to play phone tag or wander around the office to set up meetings,\" Mr. Vernon says. \"Now three guys working in the same area can just wheel their chairs around a computer terminal.\" As a result, Approach is getting its high-margin product -- client proposals -- to market at least 20% faster than before. \"We think a significant portion of this improved performance is directly attributable to our new office space,\" Mr. Vernon says.\n",

      " 1,160 Deaths a Day . . .. In the escalating war against smoking -- a habit that has taken many more lives than all of America's wars combined -- some states are seeking compensation from tobacco companies for medical expenses for smoking-related injuries, and prosecutors are contemplating perjury and conspiracy charges against tobacco executives who testified to disbelief in the obvious -- the addictive nature of nicotine. In this war, ironies and paradoxes abound.Smokers shiver outside their workplaces, pariahs in a country the father of which was a tobacco farmer. Probably the most powerful disincentive for smoking -- peer pressure -- is also the most powerful incentive for people to start smoking. Most smokers start before age 18 and start because of peer pressure in the search for status and glamour. However, smoking now seems dumb and declasse.Cigarettes are the world's most heavily taxed consumer product. U.S. state taxes range up to Washington's 81.5 cents a pack, and in 20 industrialized nations cigarette taxes are even higher, sometimes five times higher. The ideal revenue yield from such taxes would be zero.By some calculations, the social costs of smoking (in health care, lost productivity from illness and shortened lives, and fire damage) about equal the sum produced by cigarette taxes plus the savings that smoking produces in the form of reduced spending for Social Security, pensions and nursing home care for smokers. If every smoker quit today, that would be a crisis for Social Security and all pension plans that incorporate actuarial assumptions about millions of smokers dying before they can receive benefits they otherwise would collect.Cigarettes generate interesting product liability litigation because cigarettes are harmful when used as intended. The fact that cigarettes are harmful has been broadly understood for several generations and today is almost universally acknowledged. (The one-third of smokers who die prematurely because of smoking lose on average 20 years of life expectancy, or 29 minutes per cigarette.) The consensus about this, combined with the warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising, has helped immunize tobacco companies against liability for damage their products do. Juries have spurned plaintiffs who have said they deserve recompense from tobacco companies because \"everyone knows\" smoking is harmful.\n",

NV means Not Voting.CONGRESSIONAL PAY For-79/Against-342 The House rejected a pay raise for members of Congress. The vote occurred during debate on a Treasury Department spending bill for fiscal 1999. The bill prohibits a cost-of-living adjustment for members. Without the ban, a cost-of-living adjustment linked to 1998 inflation would take effect automatically early next year. The amendment rejected by this vote sought to remove the ban. Rank-and-file House members and senators are paid $136,700 annually, with leaders receiving more. A yes vote supported a pay raise for members of Congress.CAMPAIGN ADS For-201/Against-219 The House refused to weaken the leading campaign finance bill before the House, a measure sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.). At issue was Shays-Meehan language that would begin federal regulation of political advertising, including TV and radio \"attack ads,\" that interest groups sponsor to help or hurt a specific candidate. Shays-Meehan would bring these \"issue advocacy ads\" under the spending and disclosure requirements that govern the candidates' own ads. With this vote, the House defeated an amendment that sought to soften the proposed new curbs on independently financed issue ads.ABORTION For-276/Against-150 The House passed a bill making it a federal crime to transport a minor to another state for an abortion, in order to avoid parental consent or notification laws in the girl's home state. The bill does not apply when the abortion is necessary to save the girl's life, and it exempts parents from prosecution. A yes vote was to pass the bill.GUN DEALERS For-122/Against-301 The House rejected an amendment to prevent $2 million from being paid to gun importers as compensation for inventory they lost when President Clinton recently banned the importation of certain assault weapons. The weapons were \"in transit\" to the U.S. dealers at the time of the April 6, 1998, ban. This vote occurred during debate on the Treasury Department's fiscal 1999 spending bill. The amendment sought to transfer the $2 million to the hiring of more agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), a Treasury agency that enforces gun laws. A yes vote was to spend $2 million on ATF agents rather than to compensate certain gun importers for loss of property.\n",

      " Big Nongovernment. The splendid Benaroya symphony hall, built with donations from Seattle's prosperous global firms, was crammed over the weekend with an impressively global assortment of globalization's critics. Along the sleek slate-and-steel hallway, activists from five continents clustered by the latte bars: African campaigners for debt relief, Brazilian defenders of rain forests, Indians opposed to neocolonial investment, European haters of beef hormones, Canadians concerned about everything.Inside the auditorium, a marathon teach-in was underway, convened to denounce the World Trade Organization as \"one of the world's most powerful, secretive, undemocratic and dangerous bodies.\" And yet this festival of activism suggested a rather different notion. Perhaps the activists themselves are the real stealth world government?Last time trade liberalizing talks were launched, in Uruguay in 1986, 12 nongovernmental organizations registered to observe the process. But the reach and clout of NGOs have since expanded marvelously, courtesy of the Internet. NGOs set the agenda for the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and lobbied governments to attend; they publicized the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico in 1994, so preventing the Mexican government from suppressing it violently. Three years ago Jessica Mathews, now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested that centuries of governmental dominance might finally be ending.If that was plausible three years ago, it now seems even more compelling. In 1997 a loose alliance of 350 NGOs from 23 countries set out to ban land mines; they soon persuaded 122 nations to sign on to a treaty. In 1998 another NGO alliance, this time reckoned to number 600 groups in nearly 70 countries, sank a painstakingly negotiated treaty on multilateral investment. This year yet another coalition, known as Jubilee 2000, led an international lobbying effort for Third World debt relief. During the recent budget fight, Jubilee pressure had much to do with the congressional Republicans' last-minute assent to provide money for debt cancellation.Fresh from those victories, the NGO community has descended on Seattle to take on the international trading system. Many of the lead players from previous NGO victories are there; they greet each other in hallways with the camaraderie of veterans. Their rhetoric paints the World Trade Organization as a proto-government possessed of frightening power, but their own clout is just as striking. The WTO has a budget of just $80 million a year and a staff of fewer than 500. NGO coalitions wield more money and have thousands of expert delegates in Seattle.\n",

Penney Co., riding a wave of brisk apparel sales, reported sharply higher second-quarter earnings and said they are optimistic about the rest of the year.Dayton's net income doubled and Penney's jumped 21% even as some other retailers reported weak results amid general uncertainty about consumer spending. Monday, for example, K mart Corp. said second-quarter net fell 11%.\"If you're in the apparel business, results are better than expected,\" said Daniel Barry, analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. \"If not, you're running a little short.\"Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, said net for the quarter ended July 29 jumped to a record $56 million, or 72 cents a share, from $28 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter was boosted by a pretax gain of $10 million from the partial reversal of a reserve taken earlier for closing a unit. Revenue rose 15% to $3.1 billion from $2.69 billion.J.C. Penney, based in Dallas, said net rose to $98 million, or 74 cents a share, from $81 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 7% to $3.44 billion from $3.21 billion.\n",

      " Thankless Bipartisanship. On Monday, with few of his colleagues present and the Senate press galleries largely unoccupied, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee took the floor to make one of those statements that fill the Congressional Record but rarely go any further.\"Last week,\" he said, \"while the media covered Iraq and U.S. attorneys, the Senate spent three days debating and passing perhaps the most important piece of legislation of this two-year session. Almost no one noticed.\"Alexander has a point. The bill, boldly named the America Competes Act, authorized an additional $16 billion over four years as part of a $60 billion effort to \"double spending for physical sciences research, recruit 10,000 new math and science teachers and retrain 250,000 more, provide grants to researchers and invest more in high-risk, high-payoff research.\"As Alexander noted, \"these were recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences task force\" that he and others had asked to tell Congress the 10 things it most urgently needed to do \"to help America keep its brainpower advantage so we can keep our jobs from going to China and India.\"Back in December 2005, I wrote about the report that Alexander and Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici, both of New Mexico, had requested -- and about the bipartisan support that seemed to be available for this \"competitiveness\" agenda. I even suggested that it was a natural topic for President Bush's 2006 State of the Union address if he wanted to break through the growing partisan roadblocks on Capitol Hill.\n",

      " A Tax Escape for the Few: A Tax Escape for the Few. In the past year, a group of individuals interested in investment banking and the stock market, with the aid of Washington legal advisers, has been quietly pushing a proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains.A Senate finance subcommittee already has held little-publicized hearings on the proposal, and it is now being promoted before the House Ways and Means Committee as a UItax reform.UThe essence of this proposal is that the proportion of a capital gain included in taxable incomeUOwhich now is only 50 per cent, of the gainUOshould he reduced still further. The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families. Recent statistics of income indicate that individuals and families with incomes above $25,000UO about 3 per cent of all lax returnsUOaccount for around 55 per cent of all capital gains. Taxpayers with more than $100,000 of incomeUOabout 0.1 per cent of all returnsUOreceive about 30 per cent of all capital gains.\n",

      " U.S. News: Florida's Scott, Facing Fight, Touts Economy --- Polls Show Governor in Tight Race With Predecessor Crist; Did His Actions, or National Turnaround, Lower Jobless Rate?. MIAMI -- As Florida Gov. Rick Scott campaigns for re-election, his pitch boils down to this: Look at the numbers.Under his watch, the state's jobless rate has fallen to 6.2% from 10.9% when he took office in 2011, the nation's third-largest decline. Employment rose by 470,000 jobs, or 6.5%, the seventh-best gain. And rising tax revenue yielded a $1.2 billion budget surplus this year.Yet Mr. Scott, a Republican, finds himself in a close race with Charlie Crist, his likely Democratic opponent, who accrued dismal statistics as his immediate predecessor. Florida lost roughly 825,000 jobs during Mr. Crist's four years as governor ending in 2011, primarily due to the worst global economic downturn in a generation. The state also grappled with a $3.6 billion budget shortfall the year Mr. Crist left office.Mr. Scott faces a quandary similar to that facing many Republican governors seeking re-election this year after arguing that austerity steps would boost their states: The economy is improving, but many voters remain gloomy about the future. Will they come to see the recovery as strong -- and credit state policies for that -- or see the change as part of broad, national trends?In Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has dubbed himself the \"Comeback Kid,\" citing tax cuts and deficit reduction in part for boosting employment by 123,000 jobs, or 5.2%, just ahead of the national average of 5.1%.\n",

      " Home Prices: How's Your Town Doing?. [Home values keep climbing across the U.S. But we looked at 500 neighborhoods -- and found slowdowns in some surprising spots. June Fletcher tours the towns to watch.]THEY'RE UP 16% in a Washington, D.C., suburb, but losing steam in Denver. And just outside Los Angeles, home prices in the hillside town of La Canada Flintridge have shot up more than 23% from a year earlier. \"We've been discovered,\" says Michael Braverman, who expects to get $500,000 more for his home than he paid five years ago.Forget watching the stock market. The best -- and maybe the only -- game in town these days is the remarkably resilient real-estate market. Last year alone, amid all the bad news, home prices still rose by 7% nationally -- and some economists believe things will be almost as strong this year. And yet, many homeowners are holding their breath, worrying about the \"bubble\" and asking: What about my town?We've got some answers. In an exhaustive town-by-town survey, we looked at home prices in more than 500 upscale ZIP Codes, taking a snapshot of prices last year and comparing them with the year before. We found that nobody in Greenwich, Conn., or Southern California is losing sleep. But who'd have thought duplex-lined Beach Haven, N.J., would be in the top 10 nationally for growth -- or that so many other overlooked communities would be so strong (introducing . . . Mattapoisett, Mass.). In last place? No, it's not Silicon Valley.But our biggest surprise, given all the news, was just how many hot markets seem to be cooling off. Indeed, according to our survey by housing specialists Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss, the growth rate of prices in fully a third of our towns has slowed from the same time frame a year earlier. \"There's just air coming out of the market,\" says David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, who expects price growth to slow nationally to about 4% this year.\n",

      " What Bush Owes Sununu; And how it affects us.. In the spring of 1988, soon after George Bush had cinched the Republican presidential nomination by sweeping the southern \"Super Tuesday\" primaries, I asked the late Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, how much he thought things might be different had Bush lost the earlier New Hampshire primary.\"I thought at the time - and I still think,\" he said, \"that winning New Hampshire made his nomination 80 percent sure. We lose there, I'd guess we had a 20 percent chance.\"Atwater spoke from the knowledge that if Bush's shocking third-place finish in Iowa (behind Bob Dole and Pat Robertson) had been followed by another loss to Dole in New Hampshire, the \"fire wall\" Atwater had built for Super Tuesday in the South would have been breached. The 14,000-vote margin in New Hampshire kept the South in line and, given Michael Dukakis's general-election swoon, made New Hampshire the most important election of the whole year for Bush.You have to recall this history to understand why Bush has stood by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu in all the gleeful sniping about Sununu's extravagant use of military aircraft as his personal taxi service. The bonds that were forged that week in New Hampshire, when Gov. Sununu and his organization helped save Bush's dream of the presidency, were bonds of steel.Remember that Bush had failed twice in Texas to emulate his father's success in becoming a U.S. senator. Consider that in 1980, after 10 years of working his way back into political prominence, Bush's loss in New Hampshire had effectively ended his presidential bid. And recall that the polls in New Hampshire in February 1988 showed Dole overcoming Bush's early advantage.\n",

      " Art Market Euphoria Is Wearing Off; Realism's Setting In After Stock Drop. NEW YORK -- A portrait of the art market after this week would probably contain a greater share of somber hues.Art dealers and art collectors across the country say the wild swings in the stock market may damp some of the euphoria that has characterized the art market in recent years. A number of dealers report that buyers who had paintings on hold or who had planned to purchase paintings are calling to postpone or cancel the deals. And some art experts expect the stratospheric prices that some works have commanded will return to more realistic levels -- just as the important fall auction season is beginning.\"I think the speculative fever (in art-buying) will subside now,\" says Lewis Manilow, a Chicago real-estate investor and major art collector. \"This (stock market crash) is a dash of realism, and the art world needs some realism, too. It can't be endless.\"Adds W. Graham Arader III, a print dealer who owns galleries in seven cities: \"The art boom is over. It just got too high and it's over.\" Mr. Arader says he did a brisk business in August, especially to \"Forbes 400 people,\" but that even before the crash, less-affluent collectors had stopped buying. \"We did seven antique shows in the past three weeks, and we couldn't sell a thing,\" he says. \"That has me scared.\"No one expects the art market to collapse in a heap: There is no Dow Jones average that lumps together Louis XIV furniture and Picasso paintings. \"Blue chip\" art works have historically held their value much better than lower quality pieces in a downturn, and the Van Gogh iris painting set for sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 11 is still expected to fetch about $30 million, the second-highest price ever for a painting.

      " All Fall Down. The collapse of the stock market -- of any stock market -- is one of the few truly predictable events in this life. With remarkable certainty, we know that prices will rise to ridiculous peaks and then plunge or collapse to ridiculous lows. The timing, alas, is a mystery. We have learned, however, that just before crashes and prolonged bear markets, the country often gets happy, even giddy over the market's doing so well so long. Shrewd market watchers take this as the surest sign that a bull market is in the throes of death, even before the decline becomes visible.Maury Klein's Rainbow's End recounts the national zaniness that coincided with the decision by millions of Americans to step into the stock market for the first time in the mid- and late 1920s. Many argued that the country's economy had entered a \"new era of prosperity,\" as President Calvin Coolidge expressed it. Who, after all, could argue with what Frederick Lewis Allen later called \"a ceaseless flow of new delights\": the automobile, the telephone, movies, radios, refrigerators, record players? In corporate boardrooms, something called \"scientific management\" was taking hold to replace the apparently unscientific management of days gone by, when managers simply did what they thought would make money.For the first time in the 1920s, Wall Street firms marketed stocks to the public en masse. The number of \"investment trusts,\" the precursors to today's mutual funds, increased sixfold, with more attention paid to the big names running the funds than to the funds' potential risks and benefits. The number of Americans owning stocks shot from about 500,000 to 15 million. On Oct. 15, 1929, Yale professor Irving Fisher declared (infamously, in hindsight) that \"stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.\" Nine days later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began a long and steep plunge that stripped the market of 40 percent of its value in three weeks and continued, with a few interruptions, into 1932. \"All I lost was two hundred and forty thousand dollars,\" Groucho Marx said later. \"I would have lost more but that was all the money I had.\"The apparent parallels between the period before the crash of 1929 (the New Era) and the period that led to the market collapse of 2000 and early 2001 (the New Economy) are obvious and have been noted ad nauseum anecdotally in the financial press for two years. Klein, a historian of business and finance, evidently thought it beyond his mission to use the opportunity to explore the similarities, which would have made the book more pointed and useful as a vivid reminder of the ever-present risks intrinsic to equities, which are casually ignored as professionals strive to keep alive the mythology that however bleak the moment, everything will be fine if investors just hold on long enough. One wonders how many investors are aware that after 1929, the Dow didn't regain its pre-crash level until 1954. Twenty-five years is a lot of holding on.Klein's book is not the best place to absorb the market's history. It's painfully slow. It advances no particularly new angles or theories. In its lack of analysis, it doesn't demonstrate why the crash is a \"pivotal moment\" in American history fit for inclusion in the Oxford University Press's series of the same name. The author could not resist the common tendency to see every event as either causal or emblematic of the main event of the '29 crash. Klein suggests, for example, that the fad of flagpole sitting and the craze for flying in the '20s were somehow symbolic of the idea that the market could defy gravity. He is equally unconvincing in his efforts to connect everyone from Babe Ruth to evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to a \"mood\" of \"escapism\" somehow connected with the stock market.\n",

      " The White House Is Serious, but Not in the GOP's Way. Regarding Kimberley Strassel's \"This Unserious White House\" (Potomac Watch, Nov. 30): A White House that is deadly serious about transforming America and a president who openly admits a willingness to sacrifice growth for fairness need not be too serious about averting a fiscal cliff. If primary objectives are to expand the welfare state and redistribute as much income as possible in the process, the fiscal cliff and a possible recession are not so alarming, particularly since the media are teed up to blame obstinate Republicans for an impasse. The Journal's same-day news headline \"Obama's Cliff Offer Spurned\" generally leads a skim-reader to sympathize with the one being spurned, not the one doing the spurning.For historical perspective on the Obama era, the 1930s are most instructive. In the mid-1930s President Franklin Roosevelt's second term was dedicated to preserving New Deal entitlements and programs and building federal government power. Economic growth was an afterthought. Unemployment was about 15% when his second term began and about 15% when it ended (and higher in between). The stock market sank. Washington grew much faster than the private sector. FDR's legacy, had he not served a third term after 1940, would be: He saved capitalism from itself after Republicans and Wall Street mucked it up; he created massive new benefit plans and vastly increased the state's reach and resources; and he browbeat the rich into submission while redistributing income with a vengeance. He did not, however, engineer a sustained economic recovery. Instead, he transformed the nation in eight years and for that he most likely would be ranked as a top-10 president regardless of his poor economic results and without his World War II leadership.The economy has its ups and downs, and President Obama has been immunized from responsibility for the downs -- as was FDR. Widespread tax increases, drastic cuts in defense spending, no substantive reform of entitlements and little White House accountability for economic pain may be a perfectly acceptable, if not desirable, outcome. It actually may be harder for President Obama to leapfrog FDR on the transformation (and top-five presidential ranking) scale if the economy is humming along and people need less help from Washington. The fiscal cliff is as rare an opportunity as was the Great Depression to permanently alter the balance of power between public and private sectors. What would FDR do?Jim MooreFalls Church, Va.\n",

      " May You Find Heaps of Good Fortune. Earlier this year, Christie's auction house offered for sale an unusual work of art -- a mountain of 10,000 fortune cookies stacked in the corner of a room. It was conceived by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a Cuban-born \"minimalist\" who died in 1996. Other works in his oeuvre include a \"carpet\" of candies neatly packaged in cellophane, a photograph of an unmade bed and strings of faint light bulbs suspended from a ceiling or draped across a wall. The asking price for the cookie \"installation\": $600,000 to $800,000.Vaunting the art, a Christie's executive conjectured that fortune cookies, with their cheerful adages, inject a measure of optimism into an often dismal world. It's a fascinating if pompous notion, but hardly one that would have occurred to me during my Brooklyn childhood in the 1930s, when my parents, brother and I gathered on Sunday evenings with uncles, aunts and cousins for supper at the Pearl Dragon, as our favorite Chinese restaurant was grandly titled. Catering to its heavily Jewish clientele, the restaurant disguised wonton as kreplach on the menu and only closed twice a year -- on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah.The gargantuan dinners ran the spectrum from egg drop soup, moo goo gai pan, chicken chow mein and shrimp in lobster sauce, to barbecued spareribs, pepper beef, fried noodles and bowls of steamed rice. But they always culminated with the ubiquitous fortune cookie. Over cups of fragrant jasmine tea, we would crack them open and gleefully recite their saccharin maxims: \"Hard work reaps rewards,\" \"You will ride the train to success,\" \"Honesty is the best policy\" and, of course, \"Romance awaits you.\"Subsequently, as I developed an interest in Chinese cuisine, I learned that fortune cookies are as American as apple pie a la mode. One version holds that they were invented in 1916 by a Los Angeles noodle manufacturer, David Jung, who purportedly drew his inspiration from a surreptitious practice reaching back to the 14th century, when the Mongols still ruled China.Dissidents struggling to oust the \"barbarians\" communicated with each other by concealing messages inside \"moon cakes,\" festival pastries typically filled with lotus seed paste. Thanks to their clever gimmick, they triumphed and founded the Ming dynasty. Jung, who was looking for items to expand his repertoire, figured that these buns could be Westernized.\n",

      " Theories Abound On `Conspiracy' To Aid Dollar. As the dollar has risen over the past month, speculation has been mounting that Bush's presidential campaign is the intended beneficiary of a joint effort by U.S., Japanese and European officials to inject the American economy with a quick fix of foreign money. In Washington, on Wall Street and in overseas capitals, conspiracy theories are flying thick and fast.Yesterday, for example, Charles Lieberman, a senior economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., sent a memo to financial-market traders at the big New York bank describing an \"unholy alliance\" between the U.S. Treasury and Japanese officials to buoy the dollar.And on The New York Times' op-ed page, in an article entitled \"How Bonn, Tokyo Slyly Help Bush,\" investment banker Jeffrey Garten charged that the governments of West Germany and Japan have decided that \"George Bush is their man, and they are propping up the dollar to assure him smooth economic sailing in the campaign.\" Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, most commonly cited as the architect of the alleged conspiracy because of his closeness to Bush, wasn't available for comment yesterday. But several weeks ago, when the theories first began circulating, he described the speculation as \"ridiculous.\" He told an NBC News interviewer that foreigners \"are interested in promoting dollar stability because it is in their best interest and it is in the best interests of the world economy.\"Other U.S. officials, along with many independent analysts, agree. They note that the recent rise in the dollar appears to be attributable to strong demand for the U.S. currency by private overseas investors, rather than the active intervention of foreign governments. In fact, the West German central bank has been trying especially hard to brake the U.S. currency's ascent in recent days by selling dollars it holds. Moreover, the behavior of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which strongly influences the dollar, hasn't been helpful to Bush; the Fed has driven interest rates up.But those arguments haven't quelled the speculation that something suspicious is going on. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last week, economist David Hale of Kemper Financial Services Inc. said: \"Although no one is yet calling George Bush the Manchurian candidate of 1988, he has been the effective beneficiary of the effort by central banks in Japan, Taiwan and elsewhere to restrain our inflation and interest rates through exchange market intervention.\"\n",

      " Today's Overpriced Internet Stocks Won't Bring Hefty Long-Term Profits. You can't escape Internet Insanity these days. Scarcely a week passes, it seems, without us reading, hearing or seeing a story about how some company most of us never heard of will make a gazillion dollars from the Internet, the international network that lets computers communicate with one another. The world is full of people buying Internet stocks in search of the next Microsoft Corp. But you don't need to know much about Web browsers or servers or other high-technology stuff to see that it's almost impossible for any of today's Internet stocks to be the next Microsoft.It's a question of math, not technology. Even with the sharp drops of the past three trading days, stocks of Internet companies are trading at levels I consider insanely high. If you overpay for the stock of even a very good company, it's almost impossible to make a superior long-term profit. And long-term profit is what we small nonprofessional investors should worry about. You short-term types, find a different article to read.The simplest illustration is Netscape Communications Corp., which sold stock in August at $28 a share and currently sells for almost five times as much. Netscape's backers says the company will use its World Wide Web browser technology (which lets you find things on the Internet) to dominate the Internet the way that Microsoft parlayed its operating system technology into domination of large parts of the PC software business. But even if Netscape ends up wildly successful, it's virtually impossible for anyone buying Netscape stock at today's prices to get a Microsoft-like return. Here's why. If you bought 100 shares of Microsoft at its initial public offering in 1986 for $2,100, you now own 1,800 shares worth $158,400 at yesterday's closing price. Call it a 75-to-1 return in just under 10 years.Netscape closed yesterday at $130.25 a share. For you to make a 75-to-1 return in less than 10 years, Netscape stock has to rise to almost $9,800 a share by the year-end of 2004. Its 40.8 million shares (including stock under option, as do all the valuations in this article) are valued in the stock market at around $5.3 billion. For you to buy now and make a Microsoft return, Netscape shares have to be worth almost $400 billion in less than 10 years.How much is $400 billion? It's more than seven times the current value of all the shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Microsoft. About 13 Walt Disney Cos. Almost as much as General Electric Co., Exxon Corp., AT&T Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. combined. You don't need a doctorate in higher mathematics to see that's sort of unlikely.\n",

NEW YORK -- Some commodity traders, spooked by recent stock-market bumps, have shortened the span they keep contract positions, reflecting the rippling psychological effects of the stock crash.Before this month's events, traders in many raw-material markets initiated trading positions and held them for several weeks to let a trading strategy pan out.

FRANKFURT -- European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said an expected increase in euro-area inflation isn't cause for immediate concern, but he warned against \"excessive\" union wage demands based on that rise.At the ECB's monthly news conference, Mr. Duisenberg repeated the euro has \"strong upward potential\" based on improving prospects for euro-zone economic growth and said he was pleased the currency has recently moved away from near parity with the dollar. Late in European trading, the common currency of the 11-nation euro zone was at $1.0332, strengthening from $1.0302 the previous day. In late New York trading, the euro rose to $1.0317 from $1.0313 Tuesday.The ECB, as expected, left its refinancing rate unchanged at 3%, where it has been since a half-percentage point rise in November.In addition to the good prospects for euro-zone growth, Mr. Duisenberg noted \"generous\" liquidity in the market and expected upward pressures on consumer prices. Although such comments could be seen as paving the way for an eventual interest-rate rise, Mr. Duisenberg stopped well short of sounding an inflation alarm. Rather, he said consumer-price increases the ECB sees for early 2000 \"should not give undue cause for concern.\"Euro-zone government bonds rose on Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which markets took as lessening the chances of a nearterm rate rise. However, European stocks generally ended lower as markets focused on the possibility rates will soon rise in the U.S.\n",

      " Wal-Mart Tightens Work-Shift Rules. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has taken plenty of heat over its wages and health benefits, but many employees say they have an even bigger gripe with the world's largest retailer: their hours.When Mona Curtis signed on 3 1/2 years ago to work at a Wal-Mart store in Hillsboro, Ohio, the 71-year-old retiree says she made it clear that weekends were out because of her duties as a foster parent and churchgoer. But when Ms. Curtis refused to work a pair of weekend shifts in June, she says a manager cut her hours in half, to just two days a week.At a Wal-Mart supercenter in Apopka, Fla., Cora Brown, 66, says she had to fight to keep her schedule as a cashier after her husband fell ill last spring. Meanwhile, the eight-year Wal-Mart veteran says she has seen a number of co-workers quit amid tighter work-shift rules. Those who haven't quit have found themselves working more oddball shifts, she says.\"They'll call them in at 7 a.m. on Monday, 10 a.m. on Tuesday and three in the afternoon on Wednesday,\" Ms. Brown says.Over the past year, Wal-Mart has quietly focused on tackling a tricky problem: how to improve spotty customer service while keeping a lid on its payroll, which covers 1.3 million employees in the U.S. alone. The key, management says, is to better match work shifts with the ebb and flow of customer traffic.\n",

      " Modish Vivendi; Can a French entrepreneur run an American film business?. How do you translate \"synergy\" into French? It's a nonsense word, and maybe it's a nonsense concept, too. But Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi, is betting his company on the dicey prospect that a transatlantic hodgepodge of European and American assets can indeed produce synergy--and make real money.Messier yesterday delivered the formal announcement of his $34 billion mega-deal to buy the Canadian drinks and entertainment company Seagram, which owns Universal studios and Polygram records. His hope is to make the merged \"Vivendi Universal\" into a Paris- based media company that will play in the same monster league with AOL-Time Warner.A comment by Messier at yesterday's press conference made it clear that one factor behind this deal is France's decades-old insecurity about the reach of America's cultural imperialism. \"For the first time in Europe, there is a communication group of a size that will be able to rival all the American giants,\" Messier boasted. Maybe so. But many a would-be entertainment baron has stumbled in the pursuit of Hollywood's irresistibly glamorous assets. Just ask the Japanese company Matsushita, which a decade ago was seduced into buying MCA, which it later sold in frustration to Seagram, which Seagram is now selling in frustration to Vivendi. When it comes to the entertainment business, it seems, there always is one more sucker.Even by recent standards of the merger-crazed business world, this one is a high-risk combination. It's premised on the belief that immense \"scale\" is essential to compete in today's economy. That remains a shaky proposition, in my book. Insiders say that even before the planned merger with AOL, Time Warner was an almost unmanageable collection of rival princes running their own fiefdoms. Add to that the difficulty of combining Paris and Hollywood--Gerard Depardieu and Julia Roberts--and you have a truly daunting challenge.\"The chance of the French succeeding in running a U.S. music and film business properly is about zero,\" one analyst told Reuters news service yesterday. The stock market certainly agrees with that gloomy assessment. Since news of the deal leaked last week, Vivendi's stock has fallen about 22 percent, including a 7 percent drop yesterday, according to the Associated Press. That drop reflects investors' doubts that Vivendi can make enough money from the deal to recover the premium it paid for Seagram, headed by Edgar Bronfman Jr.\n",

      " The Beautiful Machine; Greed on Wall Street and blindness in Washington certainly helped cause the financial system's crash. But a deeper explanation begins 20 years ago with a bold experiment to master the variable that has defeated so many visionaries: Risk.. Howard Sosin and Randy Rackson conceived their financial revolution as they walked along the Manhattan waterfront during lunchtime outings. They refined their ideas at late-night dinners and during breaks in their busy days as traders at the junk-bond firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert.Sosin, a 35-year-old reserved finance scholar who had honed his theories at the famed Bell Labs, projected an aura of brilliance and fierce determination. Rackson, a 30-year-old soft-spoken computer wizard and art lover, arrived on Wall Street with a Wharton School pedigree and a desire to create something memorable.They combined forces with Barry Goldman, a Drexel colleague with a PhD in economics and a genius for constructing complex financial transactions. \"Imagine what we could do,\" Sosin would tell Rackson and Goldman as they brainstormed in the spring of 1986.The three men had earned plenty of money through short-term deals known as interest-rate swaps, a clever transaction designed to protect banks, corporations and other clients from swings in interest rates that threw uncertainty into the cost of borrowing the money necessary for their business operations.They believed their revolution could never happen if they stayed at Drexel. Swaps in those days typically lasted no longer than two or three years. The trio envisioned deals lasting decades that would lock in profits and manage risks with unprecedented precision. But the junk-bond firm's inferior credit rating sharply raised its borrowing costs, making it a dubious and risky partner for such long-term deals.\n",

      " Laffer and Moore: A 50-State Tax Lesson for the President; Over the past decade, states without an income levy have seen much higher growth than the national average. Which state will be next to abolish theirs?. Barack Obama is asking Americans to gamble that the U.S. economy can be taxed into prosperity. That's the message of his campaign for the Buffett Rule, which raises income-tax rates on millionaires to a minimum of 30%, and for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. He wants to raise the highest income tax rate by 20%, double the rate on capital gains, add a new 3.8% tax on all capital earnings, and nearly triple the dividend tax rate.All this will enhance \"economic efficiency,\" insists a White House economic report. As for those who disagree, says President Obama, they're just pushing \"the same version of trickle-down economics tried for much of the last century. . . . But prosperity sure didn't trickle down.\"Mr. Obama needs a refresher course on the 1920s, 1960s, 1980s and even the 1990s, when government spending and taxes fell and employment and incomes grew rapidly.But if the president wants to see fresher evidence of how taxes matter, he can look to what's happening in the 50 states. In our new report \"Rich States, Poor States,\" prepared for the American Legislative Exchange Council, we compare the economic performance of states with no income tax to that of states with high rates. It's like comparing Hong Kong with Greece or King Kong with fleas.Every year for the past 40, the states without income taxes had faster output growth (measured on a decadal basis) than the states with the highest income taxes. In 1980, for example, there were 10 zero-income-tax states. Over the decade leading up to 1980, those states grew 32.3 percentage points faster than the 10 states with the highest tax rates. Job growth was also much higher in the zero-tax states. The states with the nine highest income tax rates had no net job growth at all, and seven of those nine managed to lose jobs.\n",

      " Dinkins's Team Says No to Stock Tax. New York's Mayor David Dinkins last month formed a committee to advise him on New York City's competitiveness in financial services. Friday, the committee produced the following statement on the stock transfer tax, one of the proposals being considered by the president and Congress in this week's budget negotiations:Recent discussions of the federal budget deficit have raised the possibility of a securities transfer excise tax of between 15 and 50 basis points, or 0.15% and 0.5%. STET would tax all sales of marketable securities (including stocks, bonds and commercial paper) other than Treasuries. Reaction to this proposal has been overwhelmingly negative. Several studies demonstrate the adverse impact STET would have on the U.S. economy and, in particular, on New York. We agree with the emerging consensus that STET would seriously, and perhaps irreversibly, damage the competitive viability of the U.S. securities markets and its financial institutions. STET would also have the short-term effect of further depressing the U.S. stock market, which has already fallen by 10% since mid-July.To help foster public understanding as to why STET would cause severe, self-inflicted injury to our financial markets, impairing their global competitiveness, we address the most important issues raised in regard to STET.How can a tax of of less than half a percent erode the competitive position of the U.S. securities industry?The tax only appears to be insignificant. Total transaction costs typically paid by institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies (which are responsible for 70% of trading) are only four or five basis points. Thus, at 15 basis points, STET would triple transaction costs for institutions.\n",

AS ANTI-CHINA sentiment rises in Washington, the Bush administration is caught in a complex balancing act: bashing Beijing enough to appease critics in Congress and stir action -- without provoking a trans-Pacific backlash.The U.S. is exerting pressure on economic issues and criticizing China's human-rights policy and belligerence toward Taiwan, just as it is begging Chinese leaders for more help in curbing nuclear weapons in North Korea and hoping China won't cozy up to anti-American governments in places such as Venezuela.\"If we push too hard, this could cool China's ardor for helping us\" on a number of issues, says David M. Lampton, director of China studies at the Nixon Center in Washington. Mr. Lampton says China also could potentially retaliate, for example, by shifting investments from U.S. dollar-denominated assets.Complicating the White House calculus is soaring hostility on Capitol Hill, which some administration officials call \"off the charts.\" Congress has largely deferred to President Bush's foreign- policy priorities, especially since Sept. 11, 2001, but China policy is one area where legislators are demanding a change of course, particularly on trade.Nobody has felt that more than Treasury Secretary John Snow, who recently went to the Senate to testify about his department's budget and found himself in a hearing rife with anti-China anger. \"China wants us to be a sponge for all their trinkets and trousers and shirts and shoes and all the things they produce, including high-tech, and yet, they don't want to open their market to us,\" Democratic North Dakota Sen.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's term doesn't expire for another six months, but that hasn't stopped presidential candidates from offering President Clinton advice on reappointing him to a fourth four-year term as head of the central bank.Their comments have ranged from replacing Greenspan because he's doing a lousy job (Steve Forbes) and thinking others could do just as well (Bill Bradley), to enthusiastic endorsement for his \"outstanding A-plus-plus performance\" (Al Gore) and extremely enthusiastic endorsement (John McCain).During a Republican debate earlier this month, the Arizona senator said, \"If Mr. Greenspan should happen to die--God forbid--I would do like they did in the movie 'Weekend at Bernie's.' \" Referring to a comedy in which two men take over a dead man's beach house, he said: \"I'd prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him and keep him as long as I could.\"And President Clinton? When asked about Greenspan's future at a news conference in July, he said: \"I have, as you know, enjoyed a very good relationship, both personally and professionally, with Mr. Greenspan.

WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the U.S. will emphasize the urgency of reviving the global economy at next week's summit in Tokyo, and predicted that Germany will cut interest rates again to that end.\"You've seen . . . the consensus across Europe that rates should be lowered. Frankly, I think they'll be lowered some more,\" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview. The German Bundesbank's policy makers meet today, but Mr. Bentsen wouldn't say if he expects an interest-rate cut that soon. Asked if the U.S. will press the Japanese at the summit to do more to stimulate its economy, the secretary replied: \"I've never stopped asking.\"Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who will meet with the G-7 leaders next week, will come away with far more than his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, got at the London summit two years ago, Mr. Bentsen said. For instance, U.S. officials say the G-7 has agreed to open an office in Moscowo coordinate aid.And yesterday, the directors of the International Monetary Fund, as expected, approved a $1.5 billion loan for Russia, the first under a new fund created at the urging of the G-7 to assist Russia and other formerly Communist countries.Unable to make as much progress as they had hoped in presummit talks aimed at opening the Japanese market to imports, breaking the deadlock in the world trade talks, and getting other G-7 countries to come up with money for Russia, U.S. officials are now talking about the primacy of economic-growth issues.\n",

      " From Negotiating Table to Sweatshop. Oh, the glorious 1990s: communism's fall; the triumphant gospel according to Hayek, Friedman and Rand; and the promise of tranquillity and prosperity out to the far horizons. In \"Misadventures of the Most Favored Nations,\" former Washington Post reporter Paul Blustein extols one of the dream's key tenets, free trade among nations, in this tale about the bureaucracy advancing it: the World Trade Organization. He is, however, more than a little leery of the WTO, born in 1995 at the brave new world's flood tide.Blustein has thoroughly mastered the craft of breathing life into intrinsically dull material with compelling thematic narrative and delicious character studies. And it doesn't get much duller than meetings of the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which can include hours of dickering over the difference between \"must\" and \"can.\" We learn, for example, that then-European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, the closest ally of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, believed that bananas and brown bread turbocharged his analytical skills, and subsisted on these two foodstuffs during negotiations.Unlike many journalists, the author excels not only at the 800-word dash, but also at the long form, skillfully interweaving both his characters and engaging vignettes through the larger loom of world events. The further the author strays from the gilded, stilted venues of the trade negotiations, the more he sparkles. The few pages spent with Honduran textile worker Daunbia Rodriguez alone are worth the price of the book. Her meager pay, shantytown home and miserable working conditions must surely rouse the concern of many in the developed world, but Rodriguez doesn't see things quite this way; her hut's gas stove, indoor plumbing, television and, most miraculous of all, electricity to run them exceed her wildest dreams. She recognizes her job for what it is: the prized first rung on the ladder out of rural poverty.The author deftly tracks the minute twists, turns and details of the latest round of negotiations, known as the Doha Round. He is scarcely enamored of the WTO's main cast of characters. For starters, there is Mike Moore, the profane, washed-up New Zealand politico who lusted after the WTO directorship to the point of expending most of his personal fortune on a shameless, and ultimately successful, globetrotting campaign for the job. Or the overachieving, overbearing Zoellick, who cynically seized on the Sept. 11 attacks as the central rationale for launching the Doha Round. Free trade, Zoellick argued, would make the world's most impoverished nations more prosperous, and thus shut off the supply of unemployed, bitter jihadist recruits. Never mind that the most successful terrorists, including the majority of the Sept. 11 hijackers, were anything but poor or uneducated.Unfortunately, Blustein's love of detail distracts him from trade's broader historical context. The inevitability of the Doha Round's collapse cannot be fully understood without at least a dab of history. The intransigence of French and German farmers, for example, falls neatly into place when considered against the background of their impoverishment by the late 19th-century flood of far cheaper American and Australian grain. Similarly, Indian resistance to open markets becomes easily comprehensible in the context of the massive unemployment among the subcontinent's textile makers caused by cheaper and higher-quality imports from Lancashire's mills.\n",

Volume totaled 21,363,612 shares, compared with 23,313,478 the previous week, it was the smallest for any full, five-day trading week since the week ended Dec. 22.The Dow-Jones industrial average emerged from the week with a net gain of 3.48 at 683.19.

NEW YORK -- Small was beautiful in August as microcap stock funds picked up steam and posted the best returns among domestic equity funds.However, investors may not want to build their hopes too high for microcap funds, which typically invest in companies with market capitalizations of less than $300 million. Observers say the sector's gains weren't so much the result of increased buying of microcap stocks, but rather a lack of selling as the rest of the stock market headed lower.According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., microcap funds provided investors with a 5.54% return in August. And while that was the smallest monthly gain for the group since April, it topped all other categories of equity funds during August. The closest sector was small-cap funds, which posted a 1.83% gain for the month.Funds that had been the big winners all year -- funds tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- were the big losers among domestic stock funds in August, dropping 5.59%.Over the past 13 weeks, microcap stocks are well ahead of all other domestic equity funds, with a nearly 19% gain since June 6.

      " A Cheap Dollar Boom. Discussing the falling dollar at a panel of the World Economic Forum here, a former U.S. senator said the greenback's decline was just a blip. The abiding fact was that for more than a century, in good times and bad, the world's investors have been in love with the American economy. And that ardor continues today.Yes, responded a Chinese economist, but \"love affairs always end.\" And, he might have added, new infatuations always begin -- as now seems to be the case with the Chinese economy.Their exchange framed two key themes of this year's annual meeting of global economic leaders: first, the remarkable durability of the U.S. economy, which is surging again this year even though the dollar is weak, just as it did in the late 1990s, when the dollar was strong; and, second, the inexorable rise of China as a global economic superpower.U.S. economic strength is probably the most important fact in this election year. On paper, the Bush administration's economic policies may seem profligate and potentially ruinous. But there was a consensus among business executives here that the falling dollar has been good for the U.S. economy. The cheaper dollar will stimulate demand for U.S. exports abroad and (in theory at least) reduce America's demand for imports. That should gradually lower the towering trade deficit.The mood was upbeat even at a panel titled \"What if the Dollar Declines Another 20 Percent?\" The biggest worry was how a plummeting dollar would affect other economies. A former senior official of the Federal Reserve predicted a global redistribution of demand toward the United States and away from rising currencies such as the euro.\n",

      " Ford's Economic Record Belies His Reputation; Better Known for a Failed Anti-Inflation Gimmick, His Policies Helped Get U.S. Back on Track. The economic policies of Gerald R. Ford are usually remembered as a joke. Soon after he took over as president, in August 1974, he tried to tame runaway price increases by urging Americans to wear round red lapel pins emblazoned with the initials WIN, for \"whip inflation now.\"But Ford didn't give up the fight against what was then called stagflation: a debilitating mix of rapid inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. In fact, before his 30-month administration ended, he discarded his original plans and cobbled together an unconventional set of programs that succeeded, at least for a while, in slowing the country's financial slide.Among his economic policies, \"what President Ford is most remembered for is the inflation campaign, which was kind of silly,\" said Alice M. Rivlin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a director of The Washington Post Co. \"But in the end, I think, he did quite well.\"The U.S. economy was in sad shape when Ford replaced the disgraced Richard M. Nixon to become the nation's 38th president. Then it got worse. The economy fell into the steepest recession since World War II, coupled with an upward price spiral that was faster than at any time in modern memory.Unemployment approached 9 percent, inflation ran at a 12 percent annual rate, and the gross domestic product was flat or declining. Energy prices, in particular, soared due to an oil shortage.\n",

      " We Can't Walk Away From Russia. Charles Krauthammer rebukes the Clinton administration for supporting market-oriented reform in Russia {\"It's Their Economy, Stupid,\" op-ed, Feb. 9}. Some valid questions may indeed be raised about the design and efficiency of our aid program for Russia. Certainly, the rhetoric of \"shock therapy,\" \"irreversible change\" and \"strategic partnership,\" originally used to sell Russian reform to the American public was naively romantic. But Krauthammer's proposal to disengage U.S. assistance is misguided.Russia is not Cuba or North Korea. A starvation strategy of noncooperation cannot possibly work with Russia. It is too important strategically and has too many nuclear warheads. Active, constructive engagement with Russia is the only responsible option. It is also the best way to address Krauthammer's warning that Russia will follow China's nakedly authoritarian path.Engagement must be recognized for what it is. It is not a magic wand. Nor is it a marriage vow. Understood correctly, it should be a strategy of pragmatic cooperation based on expanding spheres of mutual interest.Foreign aid to the post-Communist countries, including Russia, has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It is a bag of tactical interventions and subventions -- know-how and cash -- to promote desirable political and economic developments. Admittedly, there is more art than science to foreign aid, but over the years we have also learned what does and does not work. For example, trying to \"buy\" elections usually backfires. Trying to impose textbook political and economic models on non-textbook conditions is unwise. Pushing radical reform while ignoring its social consequences (such as unemployment) also is a bad idea, especially if the unemployed get to vote.Krauthammer argues that it is simply not in our national interest to help the Russians with their economic travails. Yeltsin, the butcher of Chechnya, has turned out to be a bad guy, so why support him? On the other hand, should Yeltsin lose in next June's presidential election -- a distinct possibility -- it would be better for us if his likely neo-communist successor, Gennady Zyuganov, faced a crippled economy.\n",

So why are some of America's biggest companies, like Du Pont Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co., planning to lay off thousands of workers?These contradictory signals about where the economy is headed have caused some head scratching -- and some second-guessing about the nascent recovery.\"Corporate executives and macro-economists are on different planets at this point,\" says Robert Reich, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Who's right? Inevitably, it's the executives. What they anticipate becomes self-fulfilling -- they'll make the key decisions about borrowing, investment, cost-cutting, everything.\"Even if the economy avoids slipping back into recession, the recovery will be historically lethargic, many now say, with gross national product growing at about 3% rather than the customary 6% annual growth for post-World War II recoveries. Adds Richard Belous, senior economist at the National Planning Association, a research group representing business and labor: \"When you go sector by sector, it starts looking like we may have another dip down into recession or a recovery so sluggish it's indiscernible.\"Not so quick, responds Richard Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"Absolutely, we are in a recovery. We bottomed out in April and gains will continue with no double dip,\" he contends. \"I don't find the evidence of layoffs startling as some do. Unpleasant, maybe, but not startling.\"\n",

      " Union Carbide Gain Doesn't Keep Indicators Up as Tech Stocks Fall. NEW YORK -- A big push from Union Carbide couldn't compensate for sharp losses by technology and growth stocks, as market indicators dropped again.Shares of a host of Internet stocks paced the decline for a second straight session. DoubleClick fell 6 13/16 to 67 11/16, Yahoo! eased 4 3/8 to 121, eBay decreased 8 5/8 to 75 3/4 and Excite At Home shed 2 3/8 to 41, all on the Nasdaq Stock Market.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Internet Index, which topped out in mid April, fell 3.3%. The sector barometer has retreated 30% from its record.Even the deans of the sector, such as America Online, which declined 1 3/8 to 87 7/16, and CMGI (Nasdaq), which lost 5 7/8 to 76, weren't immune to the selling, as investors showed unexpected fortitude despite some relatively bargain-basement prices coming into the session.As on Tuesday, the loss leaders included smaller, more-speculative names in the technology sector, while the sell-off again spared the blue-chip names. Hewlett-Packard gained 1 3/4 to 110 1/4. Intel (Nasdaq), which traded at a 52-week high, finished with a loss of just 1/16 at 72 13/16.\n",

      " Shoring Up the Middle. In the spring of 1923, a sick and frustrated Lenin penned an article for Pravda titled \"Better Fewer, But Better.\" The state he had willed into existence was mass-producing communists who knew nothing of communism. Better that the state should take its time, Lenin counseled, and turn out fewer but higher-quality commissars.In fact, the genius of the Soviet system was precisely its capacity to mass-produce thugs. One system that has taken Lenin's words to heart, however, is American manufacturing. Each year, our factories employ a smaller and smaller share of American workers, but each year the value of their output continues to rise.The dollar value of American-made goods today is three times what it was in the mid-1950s, The Post's Peter S. Goodman reported on Labor Day. Conversely, the percentage of American workers employed in manufacturing is a little less than a third of the level at mid-century: 10 percent today, 34 percent in 1950. Employers have outsourced such labor-intensive industries as clothing and textiles, retaining the manufacture of high-value products for their domestic factories.America builds ever-more-innovative products, but ever-fewer Americans share in that bounty. We generate millions of jobs in lower-paying service-sector work even as the number of manufacturing workers continues to shrink (19 million in 1979, 14 million today). Nor do manufacturing jobs, immersed in the cauldron of global competition, offer anything near the security and middle-class living standards that many of them used to. With millions of digitizable service-sector jobs (many requiring college educations) subject to global competition as well, it's no wonder that the income of the typical American household has been flat even as national productivity rates continue to rise.Rebuilding mass prosperity in America will require two epochal shifts in the way our nation does business. First, non-manufacturing jobs not subject to global competition -- in transportation, construction, health care, sales -- must be upgraded and upskilled the way many of their counterparts in manufacturing have. Second, the workers in those jobs must regain the power to bargain for decent wages, a power that's eroded as the union movement has shrunk from representing close to 40 percent of private-sector workers in mid-century to just 7 percent today.\n",

      " Kraft Foods Plans `Umbrella' Campaign. The tactic didn't do much for Beatrice or Borden, but now North America's biggest food company is trying to get more bang for its advertising buck by packing a variety of its grocery products into a single commercial pitch.Kraft Foods this fall will launch an unusual, new $50 million \"umbrella campaign,\" stuffing an array of food items such as Kool-Aid, Philadelphia cream cheese, Post cereal and Tombstone frozen pizza into a single television spot or Sunday circular. The idea is for Kraft to create an image that transcends its products, rather like Nike and Disney, says Robert A. Eckert, a former Oscar Mayer president who became Kraft's president and chief executive officer last October. \"No matter what you see from Disney, you know it will be family entertainment,\" he says.It might work for mice, but what about cheese? \"Do people care whether Miracle Whip and Crystal Light are connected? I am not so sure,\" says Kevin Keller, author of a textbook on building brand loyalty. He thinks such campaigns can help keep shoppers loyal if they already favor Kraft but might fail to draw new consumers.The ads, still under development at J. Walter Thompson in Chicago, will show a real Mom with a real Gramps and Lil' Sis, gabbing about how food helps them relate to one another. The touchy-feely message: Kraft gets the importance of family values, and makes the kind of food that families with values eat.Kraft spent about $800 million last year to advertise its 50-plus major individual brands, from Jell-O (\"Smile more\") to Oscar Mayer (\"Just Whistle\"). This year, it plans to increase that figure by about 5%. And \"all of our brands will contribute\" to the new umbrella campaign, Mr. Eckert says.\n",

      " KKR to Swap Junk Bonds Of Jim Walter. NEW YORK -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sought to restructure $624 million of debt at its Jim Walter Corp. unit to head off potential troubles stemming from turmoil in the junk bond market and from asbestos-related lawuits.Hillsborough Holdings Corp., a company that KKR set up when it bought Jim Walter in a $3.3 billion leveraged buy-out in January 1988, began an exchange offer for $624 million of junk bonds whose interest rate is scheduled to be reset by Dec. 2.Hillsborough is offering to pay bondholders about $3 million in cash and increase the interest rates paid on the bonds by about a percentage point, in order to avoid a reset procedure that might result in interest rates above 20% because of the current slump in the junk bond market. The Hillsborough bonds now have interest rates ranging from 14.5% to 16.625%.In addition, officials of Hillsborough said the company is seeking to extend the repayment terms of some of its $257 million of bank debt, of which about $200 million is currently scheduled to be repaid in 1991. In exchange for a longer repayment schedule, Hillsborough would agree to pay off some bank debt early with some of the proceeds from an expected financing of the company's coal mines.The potential troubles at Jim Walter follows several months of debt restructuring at Seaman Furniture Co., a much smaller company that KKR also bought last year. In addition, the difficulties with the Hillsborough reset bonds could presage similar troubles next year with reset securities issued in its acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc., if the junk bond market doesn't recover.\n",

Chairman Frank Shrontz, while remaining \"somewhat optimistic\" that the company's airplane business will pick up soon, said that unless signs of improvement appear by early next year, \"we could end up with a significant problem.\"Speaking with reporters here after delivering remarks to a symposium sponsored by an aerospace industry group, Mr. Shrontz noted that Boeing's market \"is a world market.\" He said airplane orders from the Asia-Pacific area remain relatively strong, with Europe weaker and the U.S. \"very uncertain.\"The stock market reacted sharply to what some analysts saw as the Boeing chairman's first suggestion that the airline industry slump could begin to disrupt manufacturing operations as early as next year. In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares were quoted at $41.375 a share, down $3.125.\"It's his first time saying that schedules going out into the future could be at risk,\" said Howard Rubel of C.

      " Britain's Saatchis Have Hustled Their Way Into Big League of the Advertising Business. LONDON -- In 1970, when Charles Saatchi was 26, he wanted to build the biggest advertising agency in Britain. Never mind that his 12-person firm was lodged in a tiny office near London's peep-show district. After a few weeks in business, he sent \"takeover proposals\" to agencies 100 times his size. They snickered.Today, however, the marketing world takes Mr. Saatchi seriously.Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has grown into Europe's largest ad agency, and a global rival to the top U.S. agencies. Its revenue rose 42% to the current equivalent of $1.03 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. Earnings in the year were up 90% to $11.4 million. Its share price has climbed, too. Even U.S. advertising giants like J. Walter Thompson Inc. are blinking hard. Saatchi & Saatchi \"has a voracious appetite\" for growth, observes Michael Cooper-Evans, head of J. Walter Thompson's British offices.Saatchi & Saatchi's latest moves are causing a stir outside the advertising world as well. In October, the firm agreed to buy Yankelovich Skelly & White, a U.S. market-research group, for $13.5 million. A few weeks later, it snapped up Hay Group, a U.S. management consultant, for at least $80 million. Saatchi & Saatchi says more acquisitions will follow, propelling it into a wide range of business services. (The firm's high stock-market price -- it has been trading at a price-earnings multiple of 21 -- makes it possible to finance acquisitions by issuing stock.)The new strategy has touched off controversy. Financial analysts love the plan, and say it will boost Saatchi's earnings. Advertising insiders say it's another sign of Saatchi & Saatchi's obsession with growth. But some clients fret that the expansion is too ambitious, and could blur the agency's traditional focus on advertising.\n",

Arthur John Keeffe, 86, a professor emeritus at Catholic University law school who worked on several committees on Capitol Hill and contributed frequently to professional journals, died of congestive heart failure Oct. 2 at Georgetown University Hospital.While serving as counsel to Rep. Wright Patman (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, Mr. Keeffe wrote a widely noted history of the Federal Reserve System. In 1955, he served as counsel to a Senate subcommittee under Sen. Estes Kefauver (D-Tenn.) that investigated the Dixon-Yates scandal, an issue in the 1954 congressional elections. It involved conflicts of interest in the award of a contract to build a power plant at West Memphis, Ark., that would have fed into the Tennessee Valley Authority system.Mr. Keeffe also was counsel to a Senate committee that investigated campaign financing in the 1952 presidential election. In the aftermath of World War II, he was president of a board that reviewed all general courts-martial in the naval service.From 1952 to 1983, Mr. Keeffe wrote a regular column reviewing current legal literature for the American Bar Association Journal, and he contributed to numerous other legal publications.A resident of Washington since joining the law faculty at Catholic University in 1955, Mr. Keeffe was born in Elmira, N.Y.

      " Currency Traders Return to Strategy Of Unloading Yen, Buying European. NEW YORK -- Currency traders returned to a strategy that some say is the only clear bet they can make: buy Europe, sell Japan.What that amounted to was the same market pattern repeated on numerous occasions in recent weeks -- the dollar falling against the mark, but rising against the yen, alongside a healthy rally in mark/yen.Analysts said Tuesday's quarter-percentage-point cut in the U.S. Fed funds rate suggests the Federal Reserve will make additional easings before year end, a process many believe will weigh on the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets less attractive.Notwithstanding recent signs that German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder favors softer monetary policy, the Bundesbank is believed to be adamantly opposed to German rate cuts. Add to this situation some additional bad news on Japanese banks yesterday and mark/yen looked like a strong buy, traders said.\"Mark/yen has been the favorite play of the past few weeks. If [the mark] gets through the 82/83 yen level, it will look like people are really coming back to start selling yen again,\" said John McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York.\n",

      " REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Big Trade 'Disaster'. The way everyone's carrying on about the 1984 U.S. merchandise trade deficit you'd think a flying saucer had landed and threatened to spray us all with poison gas. The National Association of Manufacturers is calling the record $123.3 billion deficit a \"disaster.\" Rep. Don Bonker (D., Wash.) naturally thinks the Reagan administration needs to be \"held accountable.\"Presidents need to be held accountable for things they should control, but the president, thank goodness, does not dictate how much Americans buy and sell abroad. Even if he did, he would find it extremely hard to kill the trade deficit his critics think so horrendous without at the same time aborting the U.S. economic recovery.As every dime-store clerk knows, 1984 was anything but an economic \"disaster\" for the U.S. The trade deficit stems from the fact that, with a few sectoral exceptions, the U.S. economy came roaring back from recession with immense vigor. When demand booms, it sucks in goods of all kinds. U.S. industries give exporting a lower priority as they rush to meet domestic demand. U.S. trade will move toward balance when the U.S. economic growth rate falls more into line with the average growth rate of U.S. trading partners. You will know this is happening when those who are currently viewing the trade deficit with alarm start complaining that America is falling behind in the world.This is not to say that politicians cannot affect trade. They certainly can and they do, almost always for the worse. A good Ph.D. thesis could be written about the damage Washington did to the world competitive position of the U.S. auto industry in the 1970s with misguided overregulation, best represented by fuel-efficiency standards that disrupted the industry's product planning and opened the import door to foreign luxury cars.That is why we are always wary when politicians and industry lobbies start yelling \"disaster.\" When the subject is trade, the next word that comes after \"disaster\" is \"protection.\" If the U.S. wants economic trouble, that's the way to get it.\n",

      " U.S. News --- CAPITAL: Blasting the Bailout Blues. The world has had a terrifying brush with another Great Depression. Although the recent scare in Europe is a reminder that this isn't over yet, it looks like we've escaped that -- in no small measure because of taxpayer-financed bailouts and fiscal stimulus, as maligned and imperfect as they were.Yet no one is throwing ticker tape parades for Barack Obama or Angela Merkel, or the legislators, central bankers or finance ministers. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that 42% of Americans doubt the Obama fiscal stimulus will ever help the economy, and another 20% say the benefits have yet to arrive.The ousting of a longtime, business-friendly incumbent senator by rebellious Republicans in Utah is the latest manifestation of political discontent. \"They're angry and they're angry at Washington. And I'm in Washington,\" the victim, Republican Sen. Robert Bennett told his hometown paper. Nearly a third of the respondents to the Wall Street Journal poll say they \"almost never\" trust the government to do the right thing.The distrust goes beyond government: People are angry at pretty much the entire establishment. More than 60% of Americans in Pew Research Center polls say banks, big corporations and Congress have a negative effect on the way things are going in the U.S. -- and the national news media don't do much better.Corporate chief executives frequently complain that the president and Democrats in Congress are stirring animosity toward business. \"It has been easy to vilify business,\" the head of the Business Roundtable, John Castellani, said in a TV interview earlier this year. \"That raises questions and that inhibits investment. People say wait a minute, am I next?\"\n",

      " Congress Asked to Stop Automatic Council Raises; Backlash Over Increases Hits D.C. Officials. An article Thursday about a $20 million pay package approved Tuesday by the D.C. Council incorrectly reported that council member Betty Ann Kane (D-At large) is a lawyer. (Published 11/19/88)D.C. Council Chairman David A. Clarke asked Congress yesterday to amend the city charter to prevent the 12 other council members from receiving automatic pay raises every time the salaries of the full-time chairman and the mayor's senior executives are raised.The request, which Clarke said he forwarded to Congress after the council approved a motion by John Ray (D-At Large), came one day after the council acted on a $20 million D.C. government pay package that increased the annual salaries of council members to $69,500. Combined with a scheduled raise approved two years ago, the action will mean an increase of as much as $19,000 a year for some members.Those increases-triggered in part by the link in the city charter between the salaries of Clarke and other council members-were criticized yesterday by some who fear the increases will exacerbate the District's worsening financial problems. The city has a projected budget deficit of $150 million. Although city officials said the $20 million cost of the pay package was included in the projected deficit, some council members at Tuesday's meeting questioned whether that was indeed the case.\"I believe that it is important for our council members and other executives to receive competitive compensation,\" said David Schlien, a vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 6,000 D.C. employees. \"However, I am concerned that this is being implemented at a time when the city is facing a deficit.\"\n",

      " Now, the Local Races Are Awash in Cash. Jeffrey Osborn says he was surprised at how cheap it was to sway Loudoun County's elections. \"The builders have been buying the county for just dirt,\" he says. So Osborn, a venture capitalist, set out to beat them at their own game by pumping more than $50,000 into the campaigns to support eight slow-growth candidates for the county board of supervisors in 1999. They all won.Stunned by the defeat, pro-development interests in the Washington suburb have vowed to unseat the new board, which has sliced more than 80,000 houses from county plans. \"If you are a major player in a billion-dollar industry, are you going to let your industry evaporate?\" asked Bryan Brooks, a local developer. The developers' response? Up the ante.That's no small threat in Virginia, known nationally as the Wild West of campaign finance. There are no contribution limits for state or local offices here, making anything possible. \"If you want to give $6 billion to some guy who's running for sheriff or local delegate, you can do it,\" says Steve Calos, executive director of the Richmond-based Center for Open, Ethical and Accountable Government.Big money goes small town? You betcha. Americans are used to thinking of national politics as the place where the big decisions get made -- and where the big money gets spent. That premise drove the campaign finance reform legislation President Bush signed last month. But that ballyhooed legislation did nothing to stem the flow of money to local and state campaigns. Local politics are just as fortified -- some say corrupted -- by cash as federal ones, and often more so. From the Blue Ridge mountain foothills of Loudoun to Laguna Hills, Calif., the excesses of K Street are flourishing on the Main Streets that lead to the nation's state houses, city halls and county buildings.The most intimate arena of our democracy can also be the easiest to manipulate. A little money can go a long way in local contests. The rules are looser, and fewer people are watching to see if those rules are followed. Voter turnout is often lower, giving one-issue champions and special interest groups greater influence. As on Capitol Hill, contributions often make great investments. \"People don't give money to honor America or show their love of democracy. They are buying something,\" says Calos. \"Money buys results.\"\n",

      " Stock Market Needs Anti-Dumping Rules. The recent announcement by New York Life Insurance Co. that it is liquidating its entire $1 billion stock portfolio because of its dissatisfaction with the market's volatility furnishes dramatic evidence that the flight of the investor from the securities market continues unabated. Now, not only the small investor but also some larger institutions are exiting a stock market in which sharp fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often unaccompanied by any significant external news or event, recur with predictable frequency.The pattern of these fluctuations is particularly revealing. Often, trading will remain flat throughout the day, only for prices to dive suddenly at the close in the face of heavy institutional trading. Admittedly, one cannot legislate a secure investment environment, but investors are unlikely to return to the market until they see it as a relatively stable repository for their funds. A market that can move 20-30 points in a few minutes, because of sudden selling pressure, will not be so perceived.Yet, wasn't it exactly this problem that the proposals of the Brady Commission and other recent reports were supposed to address? The short answer is no. The recommendations advanced by both Brady and the SEC understandably focused on a worse-case scenario: how to avoid a financial meltdown. As a result, short of a catastrophic event, their proposed reforms will have little impact and could even be counterproductive.Consider, for example, the two most discussed Brady proposals: (1) the circuit-breaker reforms, and (2) the recommendation that margin rules be effectively equalized between the securities and futures exchanges. Will it create confidence among small investors to know that in the future a brief inter-market trading halt will occur once the stock market declines 250 points or more? Such a proposal is as reassuring as a contingency plan for urban survival after a nuclear holocaust.More important, circuit breakers create an incentive to sell as their triggering point is neared; thus, they can exacerbate matters by encouraging a \"run on the bank\" as investors sell because they suspect others will also do so as the trigger point is neared. If trading halts are to reduce volatility, they will have to be introduced at a much earlier point and seek to bridge temporary order imbalances. Although probably feasible, such a proposal risks the danger that any halt will be interpreted as an adverse signal that triggers still more selling.\n",

      " Smugglers thrive with crackdown on Mexican border. TIJUANA, Mexico -- As Mexico enters its second year of crushing recession, at least one industry is thriving: the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the U.S.Here on the mean back streets of this border town, coyotes, as smugglers are known, lurk everywhere, pitching their services to the growing numbers of Mexicans looking to sneak across the international boundary. Ironically, the smugglers' biggest enemy, the U.S. Border Patrol, is also their biggest ally these days: A U.S. crackdown along its once-porous, 2,000-mile border has made the journey so difficult that more crossers are seeking expert help.\"This border is no longer a cakewalk,\" says San Diego U.S. Attorney Alan Bersin, who was appointed law-enforcement \"border czar\" last year by President Clinton. \"That's put a premium on the sophisticated smuggler.\"In the San Diego area, the world's busiest border crossing, prosecutions of smugglers tripled last year to 74. Already in the first quarter of 1996, 68 alleged smugglers have been caught in the legal net. According to border authorities, between 45% and 80% of those who enter illegally are using coyotes, almost twice the rate of previous years. The cost has jumped, too. A simple trip to Los Angeles can now cost between $400 and $600, compared with $300 two years ago.\"The price has gone up because of all the Border Patrol agents,\" says one smuggler in Tijuana, who declines to be identified. As he nurses a quart of expensive scotch, he adds that the journey to Los Angeles now leads \"through some incredible mountains with bears and deer.\"\n",

      " Battle Over Medical Costs Isn't Over. Many people think that the monster of health-care inflation has been licked or at least driven back into its cave. As early as July 1984, for example, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler proclaimed that the Reagan administration had \"broken {its} back.\" This assessment seems to be widely shared within the business community. And this July, headlines announced that \"spending on health care in 1985 rose at the lowest level in two decades.\" Unfortunately, rumors about the defeat of the \"health-care monster\" may be vastly exaggerated.How did the health-care cost spiral start? During the 1960s and 1970s the American people implicitly signed a social contract with the nation's providers of health services that was so open-ended as to be almost incredible. Under this contract, the providers would be left alone to determine how best to treat the illnesses of their patients. As compensation they were issued keys to sundry health-insurance treasuries, there to recoup whatever auditable costs they had incurred (if they were hospitals) or to fetch whatever fees they deemed \"usual, customary and reasonable\" (if they were physicians). Only very mild and generally ineffective limits were ever placed on the sums taken by individual physicians or hospitals from these insurance treasuries. Not surprisingly, prices varied widely and often capriciously among providers, and overall outlays on health care climbed.This benificent contract was written at a time when most experts thought the nation was short of both doctors and hospital beds, so that health-care providers largely dictated the terms of the contract. Inevitably, however, the very generosity of the deal drew into the medical profession legions of educated baby-boomers eager to do well by doing good. By the late 1970s, an erstwhile sellers' market had thus transformed itself into a buyers' market with surplus capacity all around.More than two-thirds of all health services or products are paid at point of service, not by the patient, but by some third party -- either a private insurance carrier or the public sector. As early as the late 1970s, these third-party payers began attempting to control escalating health-care costs. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, a two-pronged attack was made upon the health-cost monster.The first came from the business community, which pays for about a third of all health-care expenditures through employer-paid health-insurance premiums. It sought to control the rise in its premiums by forcing employees to share a greater proportion of their health-care bills at point of consumption, and by encouraging them to join so-called Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Under a PPO a business firm (and/or its insurance carrier) seeks price concessions from a limited set of doctors and hospitals who render care on a fee-for-service basis. In return for these price concessions, the firm offers its employees financial inducements to seek health care only from providers within the PPO network. Under the HMO contract, a network of physicians and hospitals contracts to provide a firm's employees all necessary health care in return for a flat, prepaid annual fee. The HMO thus has every incentive to minimize the costs of treating patients.\n",

      " Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Net Surge. Bank of New York Mellon Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings soared as the asset manager and security adviser freed itself of the securities losses that hobbled it in past quarters.Meanwhile, State Street Corp. fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as the institutional money-management firm's revenue from servicing and management fees strengthened. The parent of State Street Global Advisors has seen business stabilize but previously warned that results would weaken in the second half of last year because of the slow pace of economic recovery and its trend of collecting fewer transaction fees.Bank of New York Mellon, a custodial bank that holds investments and securities for other investors, said total fee revenue jumped 43% to $2.58 billion, while net securities gains were $15 million, after $1.24 billion in losses a year earlier. Net interest revenue fell by a third to $724 million but rose slightly from the previous quarter.In the third quarter, the bank, formed in July 2007 when Bank of New York acquired Mellon Financial Corp., sold or restructured billions of dollars in risky investments, a move that hurt its bottom line at the time but set it up for fewer one-time charges or losses. It struggled last year with investment write-downs and securities losses because of troubles at secondary businesses, such as those related to real estate, and ongoing weakness in fee revenue.Bank of New York Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the continuation of low interest rates continued to weigh on net interest and fee revenue. But he noted the company saw \"excellent growth\" in asset and wealth management revenue during the quarter.\n",

Premier Li Peng, who has taken a consistently hard line with protesters in Beijing these last few days, is a cautious technocrat who favors slow and controlled change in China's political and economic spheres.The adopted son of the late premier Zhou Enlai, Li has spent most of his career in the electrical power industry, rising to prominence in recent years as part of a sweeping high-level effort to bring younger, more technically competent men and women into the country's leadership.In the past few years, the short, pudgy native of Sichuan province has earned a reputation as a colorless-almost plodding-bureaucrat who is hard-working and strong on technical expertise. As premier, he is the second highest ranking leader after the party chief.If Li, 60, emerges as the new strongman behind senior leader Deng Xiaoping as a result of the current crisis, not only will the chances of radical reform diminish, but more serious questions will arise about the direction of the top leadership, according to some observers. \"I have no sense that he has any particular leadership vision,\" Harry Harding, a senior fellow and China specialist at the Brookings Institution, said of Li.Li already has made clear that China does not intend to copy the extraordinary political changes initiated in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev. In a two-hour televised news conference last month, Li said that while China favors \"democracy\" and \"political reform,\" such change in China will be part of a measured, controlled process.\n",

      " A Jobless Recovery Is a Phony Recovery. In recent months, Americans have heard reports out of Washington and in the media that the economy is looking up -- that recovery from the Great Recession is gathering steam. If only it were true. The longest and worst recession since the end of World War II has been marked by the weakest recovery from any U.S. recession in that same period.The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are \"jobs.\" No fewer than 557,000 of these positions were only part-time. The survey also reported that in June full-time jobs declined by 240,000, while part-time jobs soared by 360,000 and have now reached an all-time high of 28,059,000 -- three million more part-time positions than when the recession began at the end of 2007.That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time. In the long misery of this post-recession period, we have an extraordinary situation: Americans by the millions are in part-time work because there are no other employment opportunities as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary and seasonal employees.\n",

      " REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Why Free Trade?. The air is thick with hyperbole, invented statistics and insults to the other guy's mother. Congress must be gearing up to debate Nafta. Perhaps before we get in too deep, it would be helpful to tune out the demagoguery and listen to what leveler heads say on the central issue here: free trade.The first level head, Ronald Reagan, discusses Nafta nearby (see related article: \"Tear Down the Trade Wall\" -- WSJ Sept. 13, 1993). We'd like to talk about Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the great economists who laid the groundwork for our understanding of the West's spectacular rise to prosperity. Mr. Ricardo was a Jewish stockbroker who married a Quaker, made a fortune in the stock market and retired young to think about economics. Mr. Smith, the author of \"The Wealth of Nations,\" needs no introduction.Messrs. Smith and Ricardo first sketched out the idea that 200 years later remains an article of faith among economists. The idea is called comparative advantage. It says: Let us each specialize in the production of what we're good at, and then trade the fruits of our labor.Consider Joe Sixpack, who makes his living fixing cars. With the money he earns, he pays other people to grow his food, assemble his refrigerator and program his Gameboy. Nobody would advise Mr. Sixpack to knock off early at the auto shop and grow his own corn. He can enjoy more of everything by fixing more cars, which is his comparative advantage.Notice that it doesn't matter at all to Mr. Sixpack that his Gameboy was programmed in Japan and his frijoles were grown by a Mexican. Adam Smith put it this way: \"If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.\"\n",

      " First Chicago To Buy a Bank For $247 Million --- Acquiring Beneficial Unit Would Allow Expansion Of Credit Card Business. First Chicago Corp. moved to expand its profitable credit card operations with an agreement to buy a Delaware bank, which has $1 billion in credit card loans, from Beneficial Corp. for $247 million.The purchase of Beneficial National Bank USA of Wilmington would expand First Chicago's big and profitable Visa and MasterCard business by nearly a third -- to about $4.4 billion in loans on about four million cards. At the same time, the move would give the Chicago-based parent company of First National Bank of Chicago a banking charter in a state that has been hospitable to credit card issuers.Some Illinois state politicians have sought to force First Chicago and other charge card issuers to lower their interest rates -- First Chicago charges 19.8% on Visa and MasterCard balances -- as consumer deposit rates have fallen to about 5.5%. Banks' across-the-board cost of funds aren't much higher than that. Though it doesn't appear that any legislation to curb such rates is imminent, the Delaware bank would give First Chicago a safe haven in any event, as Delaware doesn't regulate interest rates or annual fees on credit cards.Beneficial, a Wilmington-based financial services and insurance concern, is in the midst of a restructuring effort because of heavy losses from its reinsurance business. Beneficial put itself up for sale in August, but recently decided instead to sell its major units, with the exception of its core consumer loan business.The sale of the Delaware bank had been expected and didn't excite Wall Street. Beneficial closed at $55.50 a share, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday.\n",

      " Keeping Cool In a Down Stock Market; Experts Still Advise Long-Term Strategy. The 61-year-old government attorney wants to have $1 million by the time he retires in a few years and the only way he figures he can get there on his $60,000 annual salary is to buy stocks. Lots of them. Sometimes even using borrowed money.That strategy worked well for Frandsen until these past few weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks has fallen 9.8 percent in one month and, like millions of Americans who rode the equity boom up, Frandsen is facing what may become the first substantial decline in stock prices since 1990.\"If the whole market heads south, I'll be wiped out,\" Frandsen said flatly Friday after the Dow dropped nearly 150 points, erasing its gain for the year. But the Gaithersburg man is sitting tight, even though all of his $260,000-plus retirement portfolio is invested in stocks.In the midst of such turbulence, it's not easy to heed the standard advice of financial planners: Stay calm and think long-term like Frandsen, but also ignore the daily stock tables and build a diversified portfolio that includes stocks as well as bonds and cash. Several planners said, however, that they have been reminding clients to do just that during this downturn.\"Investors need to implement a well-designed, prudent, well-diversified portfolio,\" said H. Lynn Hopewell, a financial planner at Monitor Group Inc. in Fairfax. \"That way, when the market boogies up and down, it doesn't matter.\"\n",

      " Worry While You Spend. One puzzle these days is why Americans are so confident at the shopping mall and so glum in opinion polls. By many measures, the country's prosperity is broad-based. Families are buying and renovating homes at a ferocious pace. Sales of existing homes in 2005 are expected to reach a record 7.1 million units. Since mid- 2003 the number of payroll jobs has increased by 4.2 million. The unemployment rate of 5 percent is low by historical standards. But in polls, Americans are downbeat. The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence was 74.2 in October, a big drop from 96.5 in July. The three-month decline is the second-largest on record (the first occurred around the 1990 recession).This and other surveys could signal an economic slowdown or recession. There are obvious grounds for anxiety. In October new car and truck sales plunged 14 percent. Although gasoline prices are falling, they're still higher than a year ago. Homeowners will also face bigger winter heating bills, reflecting higher energy costs. Economist Marc Levinson of J.P. Morgan expects average households to pay $900 to $1,000 more in the Northeast and $700 to $800 more in the Midwest than last year. The real estate boom could recede or even implode. Because many homeowners are borrowing against rising housing prices and spending the extra cash, that could hurt ordinary shopping. Should a recession actually occur, of course, the gap between today's strong economy and sour public opinion would disappear.But until then, I have another theory to explain what's been a persisting disconnect between our mood and our behavior: the hangover from the 1990s boom. We subconsciously compare everything now with what happened then; and the comparison favors the past and disparages the present. Almost nothing looks as good as it did then. We were marching toward a carefree future. The Internet was everything -- and American companies dominated the Internet; the business cycle was dead or dying; interest rates and inflation were low; stock prices would rise forever; budget deficits were disappearing; and unemployment was low. The powerful U.S. economy could subdue almost any threat (say, the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis).Not coincidentally, the Michigan confidence numbers reached unprecedented levels in the late 1990s; the historic peak occurred in January 2000 at 112. It wasn't simply that the economy did well. What was distinctive is that it did so well that it suggested we could take its future for granted. We called it the New Economy, which implied that the rules of the game had changed. There were explanations for all this bliss: new technologies; adoption of just- in-time inventory practices; the revival of entrepreneurship. These arguments were satisfying; they were also superficial. Alfred E. Neuman had become our chief economic guru: What, me worry?The central fantasy was that we could dispense with uncertainty and anxiety. Now they've reasserted themselves with a vengeance. We fret about China, a housing \"bubble\" (remembering the stock and tech \"bubbles\"), huge trade and budget deficits, oil -- as well as terrorism, Iraq and possible pandemics. The return of worry partly accounts for the weakness of consumer-sentiment polls. People are less confident about the future. But what then explains the strength of actual consumer spending? The answer is that Americans' personal spending decisions depend less on their general view of the economy and more on their personal circumstances -- and these haven't shifted so dramatically.\n",

      " Spending bills become a tougher sell for both parties in Congress. Congress is headed for a showdown this week over government spending, an issue that is dividing Democrats as lawmakers prepare to face voters still hurting from the recession but also angry about the huge cost of federal efforts to revive the economy.After delivering key pieces of President Obama's first-term agenda, Democratic leaders will be turning to the more mundane work of passing budget bills and renewing tax breaks set to expire. Ordinarily, they would have little trouble drumming up votes.But they are facing stiff resistance in both chambers of Congress, not only from Republicans but also within their own ranks. With midterm elections looming and Republicans blaming Democrats for a national debt bloated by the downturn and its aftermath, many lawmakers are unwilling to sign off on more spending.\"It's time to start paying for things,\" said Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper (D-Pa.), a freshman who voted for last year's economic stimulus bill but said she is likely to oppose the next spending package, scheduled to hit the House floor Tuesday. \"We've done some good things, but one of the best things we could do right now is get control of our fiscal house.\"With the national debt at its highest level in nearly 60 years, the question of whether to cut spending -- and if so, how -- is pitting liberals against conservatives, and Congress against the president. The White House has proposed a three-year freeze in programs unrelated to national security and warned House leaders Friday that it might go further, targeting the Defense Department for cuts. Meanwhile, House leaders unable to agree on a long-term budget blueprint are considering other ways to signal fiscal toughness, including a one-year budget plan that would cut 2011 spending even more deeply than Obama's freeze.\n",

      " Texas Air Said Poised to Make Offer for People. NEW YORK -- Texas Air Corp. was poised late yesterday to make a formal offer to acquire People Express Inc., Wall Street sources said.Directors of People Express were meeting here last night to discuss a possible takeover by Houston-based Texas Air. The sources said the bid would be about $4 a share in Texas Air securities, or about $105 million. In addition, Texas Air would provide a cash infusion of $30 million to $40 million in the form of a secured loan to the Newark, N.J.-based airline company.The cash infusion would serve two ends. It would help financially ailing People Express make it through the lean autumn months ahead while the Department of Transportation considers the proposed purchase. And it would help insure that Texas Air would proceed to complete the acquisition. \"We want to make it very painful for anyone who agrees to acquire People, if they fail to complete the deal,\" one source close to People Express said.People Express's concern over completion of the transaction stems from the company's aborted sale of its Frontier Airlines subsidiary to Chicago-based UAL Inc.'s United Airlines unit, which was blocked by labor union problems. United pulled out of the agreement, People Express put Frontier into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code proceedings and it failed to get the $146 million United had offered. People Express did get about $50 million from United in exchange for certain Frontier assets.The Texas Air proposal to acquire People matches the current market value of People Express, which closed at $4 a share, up 37.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading Friday.\n",

Harry just sort of bumped into life, taking whatever was handed him by fate. He was a bank teHer, a farmer, a soldier, an oil and mining speculator, and then at the age of 37, he narrowly avoided bankruptcy after opening a fancy menUas clothing store just in time for the recession of the early 1920s. Only then did he stumble into his true calling as a professional politician when a member of the infamous Pendergast political machine asked him, on a whim, if he was interested in running for a county judgeship.This is the now familiar story of the UIfaded haberdasherU who makes good as the \"accidental\" 33rd president of the United States. For much of his nearly eight years in the White House, however, Truman was ridiculed by the press and buffeted by numerous controversies and not a few petty scandals. By November 1951, his standing in the polls bottomed out at 23 percent. And yet, today his reputation is such that politicians from both parties openly attempt to emulate the straight-talking, no-nonsense demeanor of \"citizen Truman.\"Two years ago, one of our national storytellers, the sonorously voiced David McCullough, cashed in on the phenomenon with hi3 wildly successful, 1,117-page biography Truman. The book won a Pulitzer Prize and a slot on the bestseller lists for months.Now comes Robert H. Ferrell with a far more modest 484-page portrait of Harry Truman. Why should we care? HasnUat McCullough said it all? Well, perhaps not Many historians were frustrated by McCulloughUas refusal to engage with the historiography of the Truman presidency. In separate reviews, historians Alan Brinkley, C. Vann Woodward and Ronald Steel all complained that while McCullough was a UIgreat scene-setter and storytellerU (Steel), he largely ignores historical controversiesU such as UIthe vast revisionist literature on the origins of the cold warU (Woodward), the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the founding of the CIA, the outbreak of the Korean War, and the phenomenal growth of the military budget during the Truman presidency. McCul- lough was guilty of hagiography, which may not be such a terrible crime for a biographer; but his work cannot be called critical history.Ferrell also admires Truman, as much, if not more so, than McCullough. As an author or editor of eight previous books on Truman, including Off the Record: The Private Papers of Harry S Truman, Ferrell is probably as responsible as any academic for refurbishing TrumanUas reputation.\n",

      " The Morning Brief: The Fuel-Efficiency Drive Gains More Momentum. The Wall Street Journal OnlineThe Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.All in one day, oil prices reached a new record, car makers at the Frankfurt auto show jostled to display their most fuel-efficient models, and a federal judge in Vermont endorsed for the first time new state rules that would reduce emissions -- and, by extension, increase fuel efficiency -- in cars on American roads.GM, DaimlerChrysler, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and a group of Vermont car dealers had banded together to sue that state over rules that would require a 30% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and light trucks by 2016. The group argued that the rules would force them to redesign their vehicles, which would drive up car prices and drive down sales. Lawyers have pointed out that the industry must \"take into account safety, performance and cargo space in combination with improvements in fuel economy,\" as the Washington Post writes. Alan Weverstad, executive director of environment and energy for GM, told the court that compliance would cost his company $25 billion, and by 2016 it would still be seven miles-per-gallon short of the 43 mpg target, the Detroit News reports. However, an expert for Vermont contended the new rules would add $1,500 to the cost of a vehicle -- far less than the auto makers' estimate of as much as $6,000. Judge William Sessions rejected a host of industry arguments, including that the rules would limit consumer choice, create economic hardship for car makers, increase unemployment, undermine safety, and allow states to usurp federal authority, as the New York Times reports. \"It is improbable,\" he wrote, according to the Times, \"that an industry that prides itself on its modernity, flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation, especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it.\"Vermont's rules, like those adopted by 12 other states, are a copy of California's, and altogether about a third of the nation's auto market is at issue, The Wall Street Journal reports. \"California has special dispensation under federal law to enact emissions rules that are tougher than the federal government's, a nod to California's record of dirty air,\" the Journal writes, adding that other states can replicate California's standards. As Vermont's effort is an extension of California's, and California is waiting for its latest federal waiver, the Vermont court decision could still be rendered irrelevant. \"Congress has essentially designated California as a proving ground for innovation in emissions control regulations,\" Judge Sessions wrote, according to the Sacramento Bee. \"History suggests that the ingenuity of the (auto) industry, once put in gear, responds admirably to most technological challenges.\" The Detroit Free Press writes that \"the industry's best hope for stopping the rules lies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\" but the paper notes that the EPA has never turned down California's request for a waiver to enact emissions rules -- and California has said it will sue the EPA if it does.\n",

Even social programs with broad bipartisan support, such as Head Start, cannot be funded at a fraction of their authorized spending levels, also because of the deficit. But both houses of Congress have picked just this moment to launch a program that its advocates ultimately would like to expand to one costing more than $11 billion a year. And to do what? To pay \"volunteers\" to perform community service.UIThe National Service Act of 1990U now headed for President Bush's signature has received little public attention. Yet funded at $62 million the first year, scheduled to increase to $120 million by the third year and intended to serve as the advance guard of something far grander, it embodies exactly the kind of Utopian idea that has brought us nationally to the present condition of fiscal instability and social resentments.Congressional debate showed that even during a budget crisis members were loath to vote against something as noble as volunteering. But, in addition to budgetary considerations, it is precisely because true voluntarism is indeed noble that they should have protected it against government institutionalization.The American concept of service is rooted in our Judeo-Christian heritage and the frontier tradition. By definition it is characterized by selflessness and personal sacrifice. To the extent government removes the sacrifice and actually makes the service financially attractive, volunteering is transformed into another government jobs program. National service is particularly reminiscent of the notorious CETA program of the 1970s, which similarly was run through local government and private agencies and ended in profligate waste and corruption.In most cases, UIpaid volunteePUa is an oxymoron. ' President Bush initially avoided this policy contradiction when he proposed a small government and private effort to promulgate the service ethic among schoolcliildren and others: his 'Thousand Points of Light.\"\n",

      " The American Way of Death Evolves. The number of cremations in the U.S. has tripled in the past generation. The cremation rate is now about 17% -- though the rate varies widely from state to state. In Hawaii cremation already has surpassed burial, but in West Virginia cremation accounts for only 2% of the total. Americans are following the lead of Britain, where cremation has increased from less than 3% in 1936 to more than 70% now.Heating technology is a primary cause for the gradual change of attitude toward cremation in the West. If the bonfires used in ancient cultures had continued to be the only means of cremation, the spade would continue to triumph over the torch in Western cultures. But contemporary cremations are neither a public spectacle nor a private repulsion.Crematoria used to be located only in cemeteries away from heavily populated areas, due to public concern about smoke from cremations. Today, the smoke is recycled so that the carbon particles are completely burned. Only odorless vapors escape through a flue from the afterburner chamber. Most units in the U.S. are fired by natural gas. About 500 cubic feet of gas is used in a single cremation, costing several dollars.Although death customs are usually the slowest of all customs to change, Americans are experiencing an increasing amount of dissatisfaction with conventional funeral practices. Funeral costs are a major factor in the decline of burials. Since 1984, funeral costs have risen almost twice as fast as the consumer price index; today an average burial costs $5,000, while the average cost of a cremation is a small fraction of this amount. Telophase, which claims to be the country's fastest growing cremation society, has an inclusive charge of $500.Public policy encourages the cremation option. Social Security death benefits of $255 are available to most survivors of covered workers. Also, the Veterans Administration provides a $300 funeral allowance. For welfare recipients, the benefits vary from state to state. Economic considerations should not be overestimated, however, since cremation accounts for the majority of body disposals in Marin County, Calif. -- one of America's most affluent areas.\n",

      " Bush's `Chain-Saw' Nightmare. Maybe some good will come out of Patrick Buchanan's candidacy. Maybe it will scare George Bush straight.The president has been pretty badly rattled by Buchanan's guerrilla tactics. He is no match for them. Nor can he compete in right-ness. Bush, plainly panicked, threw a human sacrifice from the speeding sled, in a vain attempt to slow down the wolves. The sacking of John E. Frohnmayer, the National Endowment for the Arts chairman, was seen as appeasement of the most cowardly sort.Bush is caught in a nightmare that has haunted him since 1980, when Ronald Reagan put him on the ticket with the understanding he remake himself in the conservative mode. Buchanan, on the other hand, is living a fantasy. He is getting large crowds and hoarse cheers in Georgia. He does provocative, wounding events, like a visit to a Confederate cemetery, and his followers cackle. He pointedly did not stop at the black cemetery across the street.Bush cannot prevail in a contest in what Playboy magazine once referred to as Buchanan's \"chain-saw politics.\" In his misery, he says less and less about more and more. On the day that General Motors named 12 of the 21 plants it will close, with a loss of 16,000 jobs, Bush did not mention it in his speeches. He put out a statement of regret through his press secretary. When he talks about economic recovery, he's all booster and bluster. \"We are the United States of America,\" he says, grinning past the ghosts of decline and second-rateness.He should draw inspiration from the Democrats, who are squabbling among themselves and tearing each other up in a way that could leave them scarred in November. But he does not think November. He is acting as if the entire electorate were composed of yahoos who want to savage gays and end welfare.\n",

      " Bombardier, Bolstered by Acquisitions, Enters New Era --- Montreal Company Now Must Consolidate And Develop Its Own Products. MONTREAL -- Like a proud parent at a debutante ball Bombardier Inc. last week showed off its shiny new 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet at the biennial commercial air show in Farnborough, England.The aircraft, which is expected to carry its first paying passengers late next month, marks a turning point of sorts for Bombardier.During the past two decades, the Montreal company has come a long way from its origins as a maker of motorized snow vehicles for rural Canadians. Thousands of New Yorkers ride in Bombardier-made subway cars every morning. Executives crisscross North America in business jets from the company's Learjet and Canadair subsidiaries.But most of this growth has come from astute acquisitions and acquired technologies. Now, Bombardier must prove it can manage a far-flung operating network and develop winning products of its own. That's especially true in the fiercely competitive aerospace sector, where Bombardier in the past six years has gobbled up Canadair, Short Brothers PLC of Northern Ireland, Learjet Inc. and, earlier this year, Boeing Co.'s de Havilland subsidiary.Bombardier \"is at the beginning of almost a new phase of existence,\" says Benn Mikula, an analyst with Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. in Montreal. \"It has abandoned its niche status and is becoming a segment player in regional and corporate aircraft and mass transit.\"\n",

      " U.S. in Control: Its Goal To Fix, Not Run, Firms; A Reluctant Role as Main Shareholder. When it comes to justifying state control of big corporations, Barack Obama is no Francois Mitterrand.When France's late president nationalized huge swaths of the country's financial and industrial base in the 1980s, he made no apologies. Seizing a dozen industrial conglomerates and three banks, Mitterrand insisted that government control was in the interest of the economy. He asserted that the state, which already owned much of the nation's energy and transport industries, was best able to allocate resources.Today the Obama administration finds itself in control of many of the pillars of U.S. finance and industry, but it is playing its role reluctantly. Obama's goal is to fix them, not run them, the White House says. With regard to GM, for example, one official said this week that the administration's \"goal is to exert as little influence as possible\" and \"to exit as quickly as possible.\"Yet the Obama administration, on behalf of American taxpayers, has become -- or will soon become -- the controlling shareholder of General Motors and Chrysler, mortgage behemoths Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and insurance giant AIG, not to mention the 29 banks taken over this year by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And that puts the president in the awkward position of balancing public policy goals with the financial interests of taxpayers as investors in these ailing corporations.\"I think it's going to have to be both,\" said Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. The president \"shouldn't seek to micromanage by deciding what cars to make if he were CEO.\" On the other hand, Baker added, the administration \"can't escape responsibility for whatever actions the companies do. It can't wash its hands.\" \"In many ways, we are in uncharted and potentially treacherous water here,\" said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University who was chairman of former president George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. \"It is almost inconceivable that the political process will be good at corporate governance. The most one can hope for is that this period will be temporary, that the federal government will sell off its equity stake to private investors as soon as possible.\"\n",

      " A Serious Cyrus? Mullet Over; With 'Joe,' Billy Ray May Be More Than a One-Hit Wonder. Today's burning question: Will the name Billy Ray Cyrus cause people to sneer and smirk for eternity?Yes, his 1992 \"Achy Breaky Heart\" was country music's equivalent (actually, predecessor) to \"Macarena,\" but why blame the mulleted one for recording a song so ridiculously catchy it was overplayed into a punch line? The people just couldn't get enough. Until they did. And then they got way too much.Though he's gone on to find some success as an actor -- he plays the father to his real-life daughter Miley Cyrus on the Disney show \"Hannah Montana\" -- in the world of music, Cyrus's one-hit blunder status is cemented in awful-pop lore. But it's past time to stop judging him on that song alone, and there's no better place to start reevaluating his career than \"Wanna Be Your Joe,\" a fine and occasionally compelling collection of 14 new songs. It's a nearly clunker-free effort that boasts a wide range of material, from the winningly earnest title track, with its hints of young John Cougar's \"Jack and Diane,\" to the gas-price protest song \"A Pain in the Gas,\" which brings the CD to a somber close.Along the way, Cyrus tackles a fallen hero in \"The Man (Tribute to Dale Earnhardt),\" failed love in \"What About Us?\" and the flaws of his chosen genre in \"Country Music Has the Blues.\" On the last, which boasts guest appearances from George Jones and Loretta Lynn, Cyrus offers an olive branch to those who have disparaged his country cred, singing, \"If it makes you feel better / blame me if you want to / But I think country music has the blues.\"Cyrus can turn on the twang with the best of them, but on this album he hits softer, smoother notes as well, sounding less country roadhouse than comfy living room. Though they're on the sappy side, such songs as \"I Wouldn't Be Me\" and \"Hey, Daddy\" have a simple, endearing grace to them. The latter is a weeper made weepier when you learn that Cyrus played the song for his dying father earlier this year, just weeks before he passed away.\n",

      " Worries Rebound on Bull's Birthday. Investors celebrating the new bull market's first birthday on Tuesday may remember a less happy milestone on Wednesday: the 10-year anniversary of the peak of the technology-stock bubble.The great debate among stock-market analysts these days is whether the market has finally worked off years of excessive prices and can return to steady growth.Optimists argue that two brutal bear markets have left stocks cheap and attractive, especially if the government's economic-recovery initiatives succeed. They say investors who were too optimistic in the 1990s are too pessimistic now, and that a recovery in corporate performance could offer investors happy surprises.But some of those who warned of trouble a decade ago are worried again today. They say government interventions in the economy and the market in 1998, 2001 and 2008 kept stocks from fully correcting. Some see signs of bubbles starting to inflate again, notably in certain developing-country stocks.This uncertainty has fueled a prolonged debate between two old friends, renowned economists Robert Shiller and Jeremy Siegel. They say they've been chewing over the issue during vacations together at the New Jersey shore. Mr. Shiller, a Yale University professor whose book \"Irrational Exuberance\" warned of the tech bubble just before it burst in 2000, still worries about the market's future. Prof. Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, whose book \"Stocks for the Long Run\" was the bible for many investors in the 1990s, is bullish.\n",

Like many Americans, Mike Ferrari says his retirement plans aren't what they used to be.Since the stock market crashed in September 2008, Ferrari, 49, is not only investing more conservatively than he used to, he is spending more time monitoring his investments. He is also putting off retiring for another three to six years to build up a larger starting nest egg.Why? Things are just too risky these days, Ferrari says. \"The term 'playing the market' didn't used to mean that you were literally gambling. Now, with all of the derivatives -- and derivatives of derivatives -- one can be 100% on target about fundamentals, but still lose money because folks on the other side of the trade have not just hedged, but taken huge positions using derivatives.\"Ferrari, who co-owns the Integrity Group, a security consultancy in Pleasanton, Calif., says those positions have forced him to change his own. \"Normally, at this point in my life, I'd be 90% invested in the stock market; I'd have bonds and real estate, as well,\" he says. \"Today, I'm just not feeling comfortable.\"He's not alone.

Another 44% of workers were split evenly between being \"not too confident\" and \"not at all confident\" about having enough for retirement. Current retirees were also feeling insecure about their savings. Only 20% of retirees expressed full confidence in having enough funds to last them through retirement, down from 29% in 2008 and 41% in 2007, according to the EBRI survey.\n",

      " Two Winners, Lost Too Soon. On a gray day in a black week for government service, many of the town's impeachment-tossed met to say goodbye to two surpassingly splendid public servants, who, in their separate ways, had shown us how it should be done. Toni House was a blithe spirit who spoke for the Supreme Court. Kirk O'Donnell, a rock of decency and good judgment, spoke generally for Democrats and particularly for former House speaker Tip O'Neill. They both died young last month.Toni, who succumbed to lung cancer at the age of 55, was a radiant blonde. I knew her from the days when we both worked at the Washington Star. In the paper's last days, she was like a bright banner flowing around us. She wore one of those square paper caps that only printers know how to make, and she was everywhere. She carried news about people who had landed jobs and those who hadn't; she knew about morale in classified; and she gauged the rage of our overlords at Time, Inc. A photograph of her mourning as the Star's final edition rolled off the press said it all.When she went to the Supreme Court in 1982, Toni's fans wondered what kind of a fit it would be. Here was an institution more reserved than the Federal Reserve, stuffy and huffy and never explaining itself. When its members ventured out of their marble temple, they sometimes dropped speeches like hand grenades in the provinces. And there was Toni, who had been a police reporter, accustomed to trading expletives with recalcitrant desk sergeants who were trying to withhold information. But the match worked wonderfully well. Toni charmed the justices into some acknowledgment of the needs of the Fourth Estate.Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once said of his place of business, \"We are very quiet there, but it is the quiet of a storm center.\" Toni was at the eye of the storm. On decision day, she presided over the distribution of the latest edict from the bench. It was always a mad moment, and Toni loved it. At her memorial service at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Lyle Denniston, a famously crusty Supreme Court reporter who now works for the Baltimore Sun, told about it through tears: \"Toni was quite at home amid that chaos; indeed . . . she was quite capable of adding to the chaos, but then {also} uniquely gifted at bringing everything back to order.\"All who spoke at her service conveyed Toni's greatest quality: an obligation to be delightful. She took pride in her job, but she was also a fashion plate, a gourmet cook and an impassioned gardener. She brought picnic hampers into the office from home. She filled her office with flowers. She fed her cats lobster thermidor.\n",

The Florida transaction never took place, however.Altman and Clifford's attorney, Robert S.

Last year, if all the wealth in the country had been distributed equally, each American could have claimed ownership of $60,000 out of the country's $15 trillion total worth.Ten years earlier, the figure for U.S. domestic net worth was $7.4 trillion, less than half as much, and the amount per person was a little more than $33,000.But of course the nation's wealth is not distributed equally, and if the figures are adjusted for inflation, a far different picture emerges. Instead of being more than 200 percent as wealthy a country as a decade earlier, \"real\" (inflation-adjusted) domestic net worth has gone up only 18.4 percent. On a per person basis, real wealth rose 6.7 percent, just over half a percent a year.In addition, compared to earlier 10-year periods, the numbers in a new report by the Federal Reserve paint a stark picture.

The White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board, as it is called, is meant to prevent policy from being made in an \"echo chamber\" in Washington, Obama said when announcing the plans last year.The president already has many strong voices advising him on economic issues, including Volcker; Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

The report, attributed to \"people familiar with the matter,\" said that Summers has not involved Volcker, who is widely regarded as a giant in the world of economic policy, in shaping decisions. Summers was quoted in the Bloomberg report as disputing that characterization, and praising Volcker.A source outside the administration who is in contact with key policymakers said yesterday that Volcker, who during the campaign spoke frequently with Obama, has been frustrated that Summers and other White House staff have not engaged him more extensively.\n",

Pretty soon, you may not recognize the money in your pocket.The U.S. Mint began full-scale production of a new $1 coin yesterday, a gold-colored depiction of the Native American explorer Sacagawea that replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin. The new coin is part of a revamping of U.S. money that includes new $5 and $10 bills next year, which have the presidents' images set off-center. (Twenty-dollar bills and larger denominations already have been changed.)With the new $1 coin, dubbed the \"Golden Dollar,\" the Mint is banking on an ambitious marketing plan, a new design and 20 years of inflation since the \"Susie's\" introduction to help the new coin succeed. Officials and even the coin's proponents say its chances of replacing the paper dollar are virtually nil. But coin-dependent entities such as mass-transit systems, the Postal Service and the $23 billion vending industry are still hoping the Sacagawea dollar will provide a boon.\"We're coming to a time when the dollar coin will probably be more useful than people would like to admit,\" said Rep. Michael Castle (R., Del.), who wrote the 1997 law paving the way for the new coins. \"Because the cost of things is higher, there are more items you simply have to spend a dollar on, so this is a good solution.\"The new coins are about the size of Susan B. Anthony dollars, will be in circulation by early 2000, and are made of an alloy of manganese, brass and copper.\n",

      " President Misspeaks On Prices. President Reagan, in a misstatement, yesterday said that energy costs were not a factor in rising consumer prices, which he blamed on \"fringe items like toothpaste and Kleenex.\"The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index showed that gasoline prices rose 2.3 percent in March as overall consumer prices rose 0.4 percent.\"I'm kind of counting on those authorities that have been saying that this is a kind of temporary thing,\" Reagan replied. \"It happens to be that it is not in main items-the increase in inflation has been in sort of fringe items like toothpaste and Kleenex and things of that kind. So I'm hopeful that it does not mean there is any change in our economy.\"When a reporter suggested that higher oil prices were a factor, Reagan replied, \"That's been relatively stable. That's not a contributing factor this time.\"Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III was sitting close to the president as he made the remarks. In a speech shortly before going to the White House, Baker said the jump in inflation \"reflects primarily something that we have been saying to be the case for quite some time, and that is an increase in oil prices.\"\n",

      " Facebook Files for IPO. Facebook Inc. filed for an initial public offering, putting the eight-year old social network on track to be one of the biggest Web stock market debut of all time.Facebook's public debut is one of the most hotly anticipated IPOs in recent years and would put it ahead of Google Inc.'s 2004 offering, which has held the record for the largest U.S. Internet IPO by raising $1.9 billion and valuing the company at $23 billion. Facebook's offering is also viewed as a defining moment for the latest Web investing boom.The social network, which was started by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 out of his Harvard University dorm room, has reshaped how people share information and interact with others on the Web. In the process, Facebook has spawned new verbs such as \"to friend\" and a popular Hollywood movie \"The Social Network\" that detailed the company's origins. Overall, Facebook now counts 800 million users, with 500 million users logging into the site daily.The company's IPO would cap a recent wave of Web IPOs, some of which have struggled amid growing Wall Street scrutiny of the new crop of Internet companies. In early 2011, professional social network LinkedIn Corp. went public with a bang, more than doubling on its first day of trading. Zillow Inc. and other Web companies followed with strong IPOs.But in the latter half of 2011, daily deals site Groupon Inc. and social games maker Zynga Inc. went public at valuations that were below expectations and their stock performance has since been choppy.\n",

      " China Passes Germany With 3rd-Highest GDP. China leapfrogged over Germany to become the world's third-largest economy in 2007, sooner than predicted, underscoring how quickly the concentration of global economic power has shifted.While earlier estimates had put growth of China's gross domestic product that year at 11.9 percent, revised figures released by the government statistics bureau Wednesday show that its economy actually expanded by 13 percent to $3.38 trillion. That compares with Germany's 2007 GDP of $3.32 trillion.Whether the growth trajectory will continue, however, has been complicated by the global recession, which has already prompted massive layoffs and waves of company closures, especially across southeastern China, the heartland of its export-driven economy. If China were to continue to grow at its current rate, economists say it could surpass Japan in as soon as three years and the United States in 18 years to become the world's No. 1 economy.In 2007, the United States remained the world's largest economy with a GDP of $13.8 trillion and Japan the second-largest with a $4.38 trillion GDP, according to calculations based on an annual average of daily exchange rates by Merrill Lynch.China is one of the few major economies that is on track to have positive GDP growth this year. Merrill Lynch calculates that China will have a GDP growth of 8 percent as compared with a 2.8 percent decline for the United States, a 1.3 percent decline for Japan and a 0.6 percent decline for the European Union.\n",

      " Jobless rate rises again in D.C. area as labor force grows; Employment gains benefit newcomers most, experts say. Unemployment in the Washington region rose to 6.4 percent in June from 6 percent the previous month, according to federal government data released Wednesday, highlighting the fragility of the recovery in the local labor market.The Bureau of Labor Statistics data contrasted with numbers it released last week on the District, Maryland and Virginia that showed their unemployment rates had dropped in June. The difference is attributable in part to Wednesday's data not taking in the entire states of Maryland and Virginia.At the same time, experts say the Washington area's relatively positive labor market has been drawing job seekers from outside the region faster than it has been adding jobs.Experts also say that June is typically the month with the highest unemployment. That is when college and high school students flood the labor force looking for summer jobs. The BLS defines the labor force as working-age people who are either employed or unemployed and looking for work. A surge of job seekers can push the unemployment rate up, and a surge of long-term unemployed people who stop looking can push it down.Unemployment had been dropping steadily in the region until May. But, experts say, most of the jobs are going to newcomers to the labor force -- recent college graduates and recently transplanted residents -- and not to long-term unemployed people.\n",

      " A Digital Age Rite:The IPO Roadshow; A Former Post Reporter Chronicles His New Company's Successful Pitch to Underwriters, Regulators and Investors. Editor's note: \"Going public\"--that is, selling a company's shares to public investors for the first time--is the dream of many an entrepreneur and of the people who go to work for many of today's start-up companies. Mike Mills left his reporting job at The Washington Post in April to join one such firm as the company's vice president of business development. This is his story of participating in the company's venture into the public stock market.Our company's chief executive is about to break one of the cardinal rules of an IPO roadshow: Never attempt a live demonstration of your product.We've implored him not to do this. Should the product, for some reason, fail to perform, the presentation is finished. To drive that point home, our chief financial officer nervously recounts a legendary anecdote from his former employer: \"The guy says, 'See our new Styrofoam cup? It's lighter but stronger! Let's pour water into it.' Then, whoosh! The bottom of the cup mysteriously gives out. Show over.\"But the cautionary tale doesn't sway David Oros, president and chief executive of Aether Systems Inc. Rather, it merely strengthens his resolve. So there I stand, along the wall in an auditorium at Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Wall Street headquarters, wondering whether my boss's determination will pay off or do us in.Though our actual roadshow won't begin until tomorrow, we were reminded beforehand that this meeting--to the entire equity sales staff at Merrill Lynch, our lead investment bank--is every bit as important as our direct pitch to investors. If the demo crashes, these sales agents will hardly be enthused to get on the phone and push Aether's first publicly traded shares out the door.\n",

      " NCNB Finds an Outside Bank's Welcome In Texas Can Be Cooler Than the Climate. DALLAS -- In the hard-crabble world of Texas banking, NCNB Corp. has found that no one remains a hero for long.The North Carolina bankers, who swooped in at the end of July to rescue First RepublicBank Corp., Texas' biggest banking disaster, were sure they would win the hearts and deposits of Texans across the Lone Star State. They dispatched bankers near and far to glad-hand customers and community leaders, began cranking out loans, issued pay raises to long-neglected workers and even sent 15,000 yellow roses to its new employees.So how do Texans show their appreciation? A Dallas newspaper columnist mocked some early NCNB radio ads as juvenile. Some rival Texas banks geared up to pick off NCNB's customer base by portraying the North Carolinians as alien predators. And scores of customers, concerned about deposit safety, yanked millions of dollars from the bank.\"We didn't have an appreciation for the mentality\" of Texas bank customers, admits Kenneth D. Lewis, president of NCNB Texas National Bank.NCNB also didn't have an appreciation for Texans' fondness for fully insured deposit packaging programs. To calm jittery customers, most big Texas banks break multimillion dollar accounts into fully insured $100,000 certificates of deposit that are spread among various banking units. But in the NCNB bailout, all First RepublicBank units became branches of the Dallas bank, preventing NCNB from circumventing the $100,000 insurance limit.\n",

      " Memorial Day Travel Expected to Defy Recession. More Washingtonians are likely to leave home this Memorial Day weekend than last, a hopeful sign that close-to-home holiday travel here may be somewhat recession-proof, transportation and tourism officials said yesterday.\"You can sum up the numbers in four words: There is a rebound,\" said John Townsend, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic.After thousands of vacationers stayed put last Memorial Day -- when gas prices topped $3.80 a gallon -- AAA predicts that 730,000 area residents will travel 50 miles or more from home this three-day weekend, about 4 percent more than last year. Just 6.7 percent of them will board a plane because of the expense, officials said, leaving 83 percent to travel by car. The auto club predicts that rail and bus travel will drop 10 percent.The price of gas has risen 25 cents a gallon in the past three weeks, but at $2.29 a gallon it is still about $1.50 less than this time last year. Another factor making local travel more likely is the region's huge workforce of federal workers and contractors, which has been less buffeted by the downturn than those in other parts of the country.\"What you see is a certain resiliency on the part of the local economy,\" Townsend said at a news conference in Stevensville, Md., with the Chesapeake Bay Bridge as backdrop.\n",

      " Do Money-Market Funds Still Make Sense?; For short-term needs, yes; but better yields are available elsewhere. For the past few years, investors could probably have made more money by picking up loose change from the sidewalk than by investing in a money-market mutual fund.Money funds are likely to regain appeal once interest rates rise again. Historically, when rates start moving upward, money-fund yields quickly follow, unlike those of bank savings accounts, which can lag.But for now, persistently low rates--coupled with uncertainty about a possible regulatory overhaul for money funds--are reasons to avoid using the funds for all but very-short-term parking of cash, financial advisers say.Money funds are mutual funds that invest in very-short-term debt issued by governments and large corporations, and that strive to maintain a set $1 share price. The average yield on taxable money funds for individual investors is just 0.01% a year, according to Crane Data LLC of Westborough, Mass. On an investment of $10,000, that is $1 a year.Such low yields are unlikely to climb soon, as many market professionals think there is still too much economic uncertainty for the Federal Reserve to start raising short-term rates. Moreover, the reason money funds have been able to offer any yield at all in recent years is that management companies have been waiving billions of dollars in fees.\n",

      " Global Slide Of Dollar Deepens;Trading Against Mark Weakest Since War. The dollar yesterday continued its steady, but orderly, slide in global markets, closing at the end of trading in Europe at the lowest level against the German mark since the end of World War II.Experts said that the dollar's weakness is the direct result of general economic malaise in the United States and higher interest rates in Japan and Europe that are attracting investment there. The trading also reflects widely held expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will soon lower short-term U.S. rates even further to fight an incipient recession.\"The best thing that could happen now for the United States,\" said foreign exchange expert Geoffrey Bell of the New York company bearing his name, \"is a falling dollar that would work against recession by improving exports and reducing imports.\"At the close of trading in Europe, the dollar was down to 1.5605 marks, compared with 1.5685 on Tuesday. Trading in New York hit a low of 1.5540 before rebounding slightly to close at 1.5660. Against the yen, the dollar also retreated, closing at 147.65 yen in New York, down from 148.85 the day before.Government officials have shown little concern over the dollar's recent weakness, and there were no signs of intervention in the currency market by the United States or any of its economic partners in the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations. On the contrary, a number of experts argue that a declining dollar-which foreshadows the probability of lower interest rates-is the preferred medicine for the declining American economy.\n",

      " The Original Culture Warriors; For lower-middle-class women serving coffee to bosses, full-time motherhood wasn't the concentration camp described by feminists.. Even as we tremble at the edge of a fiscal cliff, the culture war insists on our attention. Abortion, contraception, gay and women's rights, and welfare have all returned to shake up an election season that was supposed to be a simple economy slugfest. Robert O. Self's \"All in the Family\" could help explain why. Mr. Self, a professor of history at Brown University, has heroically researched the history of the culture wars from the early 1960s to the present. He offers a provocative analysis that accounts for today's alliance between small-government and social conservatives, on the one hand, and welfare-state and social liberals, on the other.Mr. Self begins his history by describing \"breadwinner liberalism\" as the status quo of the early and mid-1960s. The architects of the Great Society assumed the primacy of male-earner and female-homemaker families. Labor unions fought for a family wage for their predominantly male membership, the Moynihan Report (1965) raised alarms about black male unemployment, and the first efforts at affirmative action took the form of quotas in municipal contracts for male construction workers. In all these cases \"women were largely an afterthought,\" Mr. Self writes. Breadwinner liberalism, he argues, was based on a model of \"masculine individualism\": hardworking, striving, self-reliant.By the late 1960s, male breadwinners were beset from all sides. Their antiwar sons grew their hair long and scoffed at verities about masculine honor. Gays, going public early in the decade as self-defined \"homophiles,\" challenged presumptions about masculine sexuality. Traditional men watched anxiously as their wives brought home paychecks and as women generally demanded relief from sexual harassment, low pay and pink-collar ghettos. Men soon saw their daughters demonstrating for abortion rights. Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and various court decisions, it seemed as if the government, the courts and their own families all agreed: The traditional male-headed family was an anachronism.But, the author concludes, breadwinning men weren't disappearing; they and their female supporters were just changing political parties. For many lower-middle-class women serving coffee to bosses and stocking grocery shelves, full-time motherhood wasn't the concentration camp described by feminists. They found a voice in antifeminists like Phyllis Schlafly, who almost single-handedly stopped the Equal Rights Amendment in the late 1970s. Catholic women and men organized groups to oppose abortion and were soon joined by evangelicals. Other grass-root groups emerged, some in support of Vietnam veterans and others celebrating what came to be known as family values. What was taking shape was the profound class and cultural divide that vexes our politics to this day.In a vivid chapter, Mr. Self describes the 1972 Democratic National Convention, a pivotal moment in the reshaping of political alignments. AFL-CIO President George Meany railed that, in the party platform, \"there were no steelworkers, no pipe fitters, and worst of all, no plumbers.\" Instead there were feminists, radical blacks, Chicanos and gays--co-conspirators in a left-wing attack on breadwinner liberalism. In reaction, a constellation of religious, white, \"ethnic\" and anti-feminist objectors joined forces to create \"breadwinner conservatism.\" By 1980, with the help of a vigorous evangelical revival, these one-time Democrats helped elect Ronald Reagan president.\n",

The trade group adds that walking remains popular as a fitness activity. \"But it's hard to say just what shoes people are buying to walk in,\" says Mike May, a spokesman for the group.

      " Jonathan Yardley. Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls \"Big-time U,\" the \"large public university with high- profile football and/or men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels.\" At many of these institutions, he argues, \"beer-and- circus--the party scene connected to big-time college sports events-- replaces meaningful undergraduate education.\" The case he marshals against these places--\"schools\" scarcely seems the right word--is overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of \"higher education\" in America.Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athletics--Sperber calls Florida State University the \"national champs\" of beer and circus, and with ample reason--but it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important.Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him (in a previous book, College Sports, Inc.) and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, \"just another number,\" rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load.Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities (and some of the private ones as well) are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators \"that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world.\" A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni (and anyone else who would listen) that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News; that ambition seems to be universal.But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. \"In the 1980s,\" Sperber writes, \"some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.\"\n",

      " Ecuador's Leader Scrambles to Fill a Credibility Gap --- Shift to U.S. Dollar Is Bold, but May Be Too Late to Help. The success or failure of Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad's push to dollarize his country's economy depends less on the technical details than on his ability to do something he has failed to do since taking office in August 1998: gain credibility.Late Monday evening, Ecuador's Central Bank approved Mr. Mahuad's proposal to replace Ecuador's troubled currency, the sucre, with the U.S. dollar. The president of Ecuador's Central Bank, Pablo Better, resigned in protest. Mr. Better was the only member of the Central Bank's board to oppose the measure.As Mr. Mahuad has struggled to deal with such multiple crises as widespread bank failures, a deep recession, foreign-debt defaults, rising inflation and unemployment, he has been dogged by criticism for acting too slowly and too late. His proposal to dollarize Ecuador's economy stands out as the boldest move he has made so far as president. The risk, say critics, is that Ecuadoreans and investors have lost so much faith in the beleaguered president that even this measure may not be enough to save his presidency. Mr. Mahuad's move puts Ecuador at the center of a growing and controversial movement in the developing world toward dollarization or so-called currency boards as pressures on weak currencies push countries to link them to stronger currencies. Some economists have expressed concern over the potential dangers of developing nations sacrificing control over monetary policy to the central banks of stronger, industrialized nations, whose economies have little in common with poor countries like Ecuador.Mr. Mahuad's proposal to dollarize is meant to end the currency crisis and silence growing calls for his resignation. Last week, the president declared a state of emergency to keep protests against his government from getting out of control. Yesterday, there were announcements of a new wave of protests by leaders of Ecuador's indigenous groups who were angered by the dollarization move.\"It's not such a bad idea,\" says Michael Henry, Latin America economist at ING Baring. But Mr. Mahuad \"has to build some credibility and break the cycle of low expectations\" that has plagued his government almost from the start. \"If this is enough to shock Ecuadorean politicians and get them to make the necessary changes\" in how the country's economy is run, \"then it's a good idea.\"\n",

      " Manufacturers Enjoy Surge in Business --- Strong Growth May Lead To Further Tightening By Fed, Executives Fear. PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- American manufacturers are barreling into 1995 like a locomotive. Their big fear: that today's strength will tempt the Federal Reserve Board into slamming on the brakes too hard.As executives prepared for the winter meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, which began here yesterday, interviews with a number of those attending the meeting reveal widespread nervousness about a possible economic slowdown beginning in the middle of this year -- but few concrete signs of it arriving yet. Indeed, conditions are so strong that some executives say they are able to raise prices on their products for the first time in several years, a possible harbinger of higher inflation.\"We see very strong growth,\" says Donald Rainville, president of Universal Dynamics Inc., a small company in Woodbridge, Va., that manufactures machinery used in making plastics. Varian Associates Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., maker of healthcare systems, semiconductor equipment and electron devices, ended last year with record orders. At Tenneco Inc., which had fourth-quarter and full-year earnings gains of more than 50%, orders for farm machinery, construction equipment and auto parts continue to be strong, while the company has advance orders for all the containers and container board it can make.\"Our business conditions are excellent,\" says Dana Mead, chairman and chief executive of Tenneco, and vice chairman of the association's board. But the association, which represents 12,000 manufacturers, doesn't expect conditions to remain that way.Gordon Richards, the association's chief economist, expects gross domestic product to grow under 3% this year, compared with 4% in 1994. With interest rates sharply higher than last year at this time, many members see a slowdown as inevitable -- beginning with the interest-rate sensitive industries like automotive and housing. Fixed-rate mortgages, for example, have risen more than two percentage points in the past year and now stand at about 9.10%, a level that is beginning to discourage buyers.\n",

      " Thatcher Counters U.S.-Lap Dog Image By Admonishing Washington on Deficit. LONDON -- The poodle is biting back.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was derided by satirists here as Ronald Reagan's \"poodle\" when in April 1986 she allowed U.S. planes to launch their attack on Libya from British air bases. While her international moniker has been \"Iron Lady,\" here at home critics have cast her as America's faithful lap dog.But she is now impatient with the Reagan administration because she believes the global financial crash -- and the ensuing uncertainty in financial markets -- threatens everything she has worked for in her eight years as prime minister. Yesterday in Parliament, she criticized American economic policy, saying she is \"very anxious\" for deficit-reduction negotiations between the president and Congress to succeed. \"A convincing package to reduce the U.S. budget deficit is a vital first step towards restoring confidence in the financial markets,\" she said. The blunt public admonition followed a private message sent Wednesday to President Reagan.After years of tough -- and politically unpopular -- retrenchment, Britain's economy is growing smartly. But if the current market turmoil continues -- and many analysts believe it will unless the U.S. slashes its budget deficit -- then Britain could be dragged into a world recession.Mrs. Thatcher isn't without some influence over her pal, Ronald Reagan. The two have a mutual admiration society where most aspects of economic policy are concerned. But American officials aren't likely suddenly to clean up their economic mess just because Britain's prime minister has spoken. Her comments, and the more pointed statements of other British officials, instead show how peeved Britons are with American policy makers.\n",

      " Transparency and the Fed. Transparency is a hallmark of modern capitalism, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has made transparency a hallmark of his new regime. Yet among our leading financial institutions, opacity, not financial transparency, has been on the rise.The combination -- increasingly opaque financial markets and increasingly transparent monetary policy -- has created a dangerous brew of financial excesses. Unless both trends are reversed, financial stability will remain elusive.The explanation for increasingly opaque financial markets lies chiefly in securitization -- the conversion of non-marketable assets into marketable obligations -- which has accelerated dramatically in recent decades.In theory, securitized markets are supposed to operate on the basis of accurate and readily available prices, the clear assessment of credit quality, and objective analyses of these obligations by rating agencies and those engaged in trading and underwriting them. These virtuous mechanisms presumably have been reinforced by a host of new credit instruments, especially financial derivatives that mitigate risk taking. Securitization also has been supported by a dazzling array of new quantitative analytical techniques that are capable, according to practitioners, of defining risk probability down to decimal point levels.So what went wrong? In the broadest sense, the structural changes in the financial markets encouraged participants to become short-term oriented.\n",

      " A Democratic Agenda?. THE DEMOCRATS made much of the fact that in this year's budget resolution they moved away from the president's priorities toward their own by shifting several billion dollars into social welfare programs. It wasn't a lot of money, but these are tight budget times, and the Democrats were able to say it was all they had.Now, however, Congress has gone from the budget process of enunciating goals to the appropriations process of carrying them out, and guess what? The appropriations committees, also Democratic, are shifting some of the money back. Interest groups are complaining that the subcommittees with jurisdiction over the programs of the departments of labor, education and health and human services have been given too little money to do the job.The question is, which is the Democrats' true face or, put another way, to what extent are they willing to impose costs elsewhere in society to achieve their objectives? The issue has now arisen a second time with the promulgation by the leaders of both houses, as Congress broke for Memorial Day, of a Democratic \"action plan for economic recovery and growth.\" As with the budget resolution, it is once again commendable, responsible - and made up entirely of goals.The Democrats' theme is that the middle class and poor were left behind in the Reagan-Bush years and that the Bush administration is now glossing over what has turned out to be more than a short and shallow recession. \"We can wait and hope that things will improve, that's the president's course, or we can act. That's our course. Democrats don't think that we can afford just to hope our way into the 21st century,\" Senate majority leader George Mitchell said yesterday.Act how? The Democrats said they were committed to tax relief for the middle class, a strengthening of unemployment compensation, a highway bill to provide both jobs and a modern infrastructure, broader access to health care, increased aid to both higher and elementary and secondary education, a strengthening of the safety net, including the federal feeding programs for the poor, and \"an aggressive energy policy.\"\n",

      " What's Left of Big Steel? After Years of High Wages, High Prices and Protectionism, an Industry Struggles To Survive. A trip through the Monongahela Valley gives a picture of what the \"restructuring\" of the American economy in the 1980s is all about. Ten years ago, the aging mills of this valley were still producing vast quantities of steel-but not very efficiently. They were a symbol of a high-cost, featherbedded steel industry, in which labor and management had united to seek protection from foreign competition.Today, the Mon Valley looks like Atlanta after Sherman's March. The vast steelworks that lined the banks of the river-Homestead, the Carrie Furnaces, Edgar Thompson, Duquesne, Clairton, Pittsburgh Works-are rusted and shuttered. The mills are gone, the workers are gone; but more than that, an entire culture is gone.The new, \"restructured\" steel industry is leaner and more profitable. Steel employment has plummeted, from about 400,000 in 1980 to about 155,000 last year. At USX, the industry leader, the steel workforce has fallen from 100,068 people in 1980 to 19,657 last year. Meanwhile, productivity has increased sharply. At USX, it now takes 3.8 manhours per ton of steel shipped, compared to 10.8 manhours in 1983. Five years ago, labor costs ate up over half the sales dollar at USX; today, it's less than 20 percent. Across the industry, steel executives are aggressively managing their plants and retrenching to their best facilities.These changes are breathing life back into an industry that, 10 years ago, seemed to be dying on its feet. And the simple truth is that if the industry and the union had succeeded in their demands for protection from \"unfair\" foreign competition-if the Dick Gephardts of the day had triumphed, in other words-this essential cost-cutting might never have happened.But there's a dark side to restructuring, too. As the industry has gotten leaner, it has also gotten meaner. With the bosses determined to cut costs, labor-management relations at some companies are returning to the confrontational model of the 1930s. The big companies, which once bargained jointly, now confront the union individually and haggle over concessions. Wages have fallen across the industry. And the jewel of steel's labor relations, the no-strike \"Experimental Negotiating Agreement,\" has disappeared, with USX taking a long and bitter strike in 1986 in an effort to cut costs.\n",

Washington area companies are coming out of the hunkered-down crouch they assumed during the recession and weak recovery, making cautious plans for new hiring and investment that seem likely to fuel more rapid economic growth in the area in 1994.In interviews with more than a dozen local business executives, a strong consensus emerged that the slow expansion would gain momentum this year, partly because companies are ready to move forward after having completed the job cutbacks and other retrenching that they carried out in response to the slump.\"I think we feel more opportunity and more optimism going into 1994 than we did going into 1993,\" said Mathias J. DeVito, chief executive of Rouse Co., in a typical comment. The Columbia commercial real estate developer plans to begin building new retail properties, something it has not done for several years.* Giant Food Inc., which is opening three stores in new markets, also will remodel or expand five stores--a decision made in recent months. As a result, the supermarket company expects to hire more than 400 additional workers.* MCI Communications Corp. and other technology companies that anticipate expanding markets also will be hiring. MCI, which employs 5,300 people in the Washington area, expects to add jobs here this year as it prepares to compete with Bell Atlantic Corp. and other regional phone companies. At Cellular One, which more than doubled its work force in the Washington-Baltimore area to 406 during 1993, president and general manager Charles E. Hoffman predicted \"continued growth in 1994, as the popularity of cellular technology continues to soar.\" * New business telephone hookups in the Washington area, a good indicator of future employment growth, have increased considerably, rising to 21,688 in 1993 from 15,841 in 1992.\n",

      " Speech of the Week; Another regulator comes out for regulatory simplicity.. The same \"fundamentally flawed\" system of financial rules that failed in 2008 lives on, \"but with more complexity\" in the latest proposals from regulators.That was the blunt message on Friday from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Director Thomas Hoenig. He was talking about the pending implementation of international bank capital standards known as Basel III. And thank goodness Mr. Hoenig is not the only voice of sanity in the regulatory wilderness.On we told you about the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane, who has shown that in many cases Basel's expensive, complicated regulations do actual harm by obscuring the true condition of big banks. Mr. Haldane's call for simplicity struck a chord with readers. A few of their appear nearby.Not that Journal readers ever expected a convention of global bureaucrats in a Swiss village to protect U.S. taxpayers. But Mr. Hoenig did a public service at an American Banker symposium by reviewing the relevant history from 2008: \"It turns out that the Basel capital rules protected no one: not the banks, not the public, and certainly not the FDIC that bore the cost of the failures or the taxpayers who funded the bailouts. The complex Basel rules hurt, rather than helped the process of measurement and clarity of information.\"Observing a Basel system that only grows more complicated as U.S. regulators prepare to implement the latest version, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City also pointed out that the biggest winners from such regulatory regimes are never the little guys. Mr. Hoenig explained that \"the most brazen and connected banks with the smartest experts will game the system. In private discussions, I find a good deal of uneasiness about Basel III's ability to be more effective than previous Basel efforts; however, there is a sense that we cannot go back.\"\n",

Within the confines of academic standards, there is no doubt. However, there are many kinds of \"smart.\"Competent? In a recent interview, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher stated: \"the Federal Reserve should not be involved in the business of deciding which assets you invest in. We've driven yields . . . to the lowest rates, in what, 237 years of U.S. history. Which direction do we go from here? And how long can we do that? . . . we are playing a central role in American capitalism here . . . and I think it is a dangerous place to be. I worry about the fact that we've painted ourselves into a corner which is going to very hard to get out of.\"Apolitical? Members of the Board of Governors are presidential appointees, approved by the Senate. They are in the sixth year of a program which, like any bureaucratic intervention, creates selected winners and losers by fiat. They are vainly attempting to execute their mandates without the required complementary fiscal policy, and as a result they are supplanting our elected representatives' responsibilities regarding the economy without being subject to election, appeal or recall. No thinking person could conclude that Fed decisions are \"apolitical.\"Despite the increasing burdens of bureaucracy, what remains of capitalism will eventually survive. The Fed can claim that its intervention was responsible, capital markets will once again have some bearing on interest rates, and we can all settle in to the new normal, awaiting the next government-induced crisis.\n",

      " Putting Some Pressure on the Fed: A Commentary Poster Putting Pressure On the Fed. 'I'lie lesson may be getting through. The SenateUas liberal Democrats, the mental retardates of American politics, seem to be mastering the fact that the gentlemen down the street at the Federal Reserve Board really can throw 6 million people out of work.Led by Proxmire of Wisconsin and Hubert Humphrey, of all people, the liberals plus one conservative, James Buckley (Cons.-R-N.Y.), have introduced a resolution ordering the Federal Reserve Board to stop playing games with the money supply and start following a policy that gives hope of full employment and steady price levels. Heretofore, as Proxmire pointed out, Congress has taken the position that monetary policy is too complex a subject for the simple nervous systems of its members to grasp.While it's true that a degree of rationality at the Fed wonUat solve all problems, itUas also true that those Founding Fathers., whom our Capitol Hill crowd love to remind us of, knew perfectly well that prosperity is so closely tied to a wise regulation of money that they mandated Congress to take care of it in a very special way (Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution). Instead Congress spent most of the last century finding weird ways to shirk its responsibilities in this regard while the nation oscillated between unnecessary booms and busts. In this century it created the Federal Reserve Board, which since its inception has continued to alternate between money floods and money droughts.This painful foolishness has been indulged in against the best advice of the last 200 years. The United States, Monetary Commission of 1876 told us what to do but we didnUat have the sense to do it: UIIt is in a volume of money keeping even pace with advancing population and commerce, and in the resulting steadiness of prices, that the wholesome nutriment of a healthy vitality is to be found.UaUa The Proxmire-IIumphrey resolution demands that the Fed do just that, which would1 mean a steady growth of the money supply somewhere around 4 per cent per year.Arthur Burns, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his colleagues arenUat mean or corrupt men. They get no joy out of seeing millions lose their jobs, but they are encased in an institutional situation which encourages disasterous decision making. The isolated independence of the Fed has grown to the point it thinks of itself as a co-equal branch of the government, when it is the UIagentUaUa of Congress as this resolution stipulates.\n",

Liberty Dollars are a proven and profitable currency that protects and grows the purchasing power of your money!\"True story, phony money. So says the U.S. Mint, which would like to remind Liberty Dollar users that since the United States already has its own currency, the only thing Liberty Dollars buy in these parts is a jail term.Liberty Dollars were coined by von NotHaus and an Evansville, Ind.-based group called Norfed, which stands for (sort of) the National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve Act and the Internal Revenue Code. In the late 1990s, the group began hawking its money as a hedge against inflation, and as a way to compete with the Fed. Von NotHaus makes the pitch online, using a raft of statistics and graphs that he says show the greenback is well nigh worthless.Norfed Executive Director Michael Johnson says the group isn't aiming to overthrow the American monetary system. \"We're not locking horns with the Fed. I mean, that's crazy,\" he said. Norfed simply wants \"to offer a solution to the Federal Reserve Note,\" a.k.a.

The securities firm, which is 61%-owned by American Express Co., wants to raise about $850 million, and about $265 million of that was expected to be raised through the common-stock offering, in which American Express would buy three million of the 20 million Shearson shares.But since it announced the planned stock sale Dec. 14, Shearson's stock has fallen nearly 30%, from $14.75 to near a record low of $10.50 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday. Shearson went public in 1987 at $34 a share.At a closed-door meeting with hundreds of Los Angeles-area Shearson brokers Friday, Shearson Chairman Peter A.

      " Book World; Surviving A Quayle Presidency; A Humorist's View: It Wouldn't Matter. Joe Queenan is by his own admission a conservative and he seems on the evidence to be a Republican, but he comes to the pressing question of Dan Quayle with a bracing supply of irreverence. It is apparent from \"Imperial Caddy,\" Queenan's penetrating skin-depth study of the incumbent vice president, that he holds Dan Quayle in slight regard and Marilyn Quayle in no regard at all, perhaps indeed in negative regard, but he goes beyond such frivolous considerations to ask the only question that really counts: Who cares?Or, to put another way: Is there any point in caring since it really doesn't matter? Queenan is of the persuasion - one that finds new adherents every time a national administration swings into \"action\" - that the presidency and vice presidency are essentially irrelevant. The \"Ur-truth about the American system of government,\" he says, is: \"It takes a licking but it keeps on ticking. If 24 lawyer presidents and 32 lawyer vice presidents couldn't destroy it during its first two centuries of existence, nothing can.\"Thus it is that Queenan views the possibility of a Quayle presidency - the possibility seemed considerably more real as he was writing than it does at the moment - with sublime equanimity. He does worry a bit about what it might do to the stock market, not to mention the market in Quayle autographs, but beyond that he is of the view that Quayle \"would just be another forgettable chief executive in another era when the rest of us simply got on with our business, which is, for the most part, business.\"This is a statement calculated to infuriate those on both sides of the political Maginot Line who really do believe that the fate of humankind hangs in the balance each election day, but then, calculated provocation is Queenan's stock in trade. In the course of his meandering inquiry into the Quayle psyche he manages to take swipes at every target that passes his way. One of these is the great state of Indiana, which harbors a \"strange mixture of gullibility, mediocrity and weirdness,\" and which boasts the nation's oddest favorite sons and daughters: \"Nobody gets famous in {Indiana} unless he or she has a really strange name. George Barr McKutcheon. Booth Tarkington. W. Axl Rose. Edward Eggleston. David Lee Roth. Kurt Vonnegut. Deanna Mertle. LaToya Jackson. Cole Porter. Thelma Cudlipp. Bear in mind that the Senate seat won by James Danforth Quayle in 1980 had been occupied for the previous 18 years by a man named Birch Bayh, who had won the seat from an 18-year veteran named Homer Capehart. J. Danforth Quayle got into politics at the behest of a Hoosier big shot named Orvas Beers, and the principal influence in his life has been his grandfather Eugene C. Pulliam, a conservative who simply hated people like Birch Bayh and, were he alive, would probably hate the current occupant of the governor's mansion - Evan Bayh - even more. In Indiana, even the fictional characters - Carrie Meeber, Kilgore Trout - have weird names. Jesus, what kind of name is Ben-Hur?\"No Hoosier arouses Queenan to greater scorn than Marilyn Quayle. \"Something in the way she moved suggested a space oddity,\" he says, and later calls her a \"truly gothic American archetype\" possessed of \"supreme weirdness.\" Reaching back into ancient history he recalls one wit's observation about Thomas E. Dewey - \"You have to know Mr. Dewey very well in order to dislike him\" - and adds: \"Ditto Marilyn Quayle.\"\n",

      " Bentsen Won't Rule Out Delay In Tax Increase --- Postponing Levy on Income May Not Be Necessary, Treasury Secretary Says. WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton administration is willing to consider delaying its proposed increases in personal income taxes to shield the economy from harm this year, but said he doubts that will be necessary.President Clinton's economic plan calls for making the increases in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount \"What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs,\" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been \"more than I anticipated.\" On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal. The new energy tax, for instance, could be phased in more rapidly; currently, it is to be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 1994.\n",

As government regulators and prosecutors investigate various accounting practices by AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online unit, AOL's relationship with Homestore.com Inc. also is drawing attention from angry Homestore investors.A lawsuit filed last week by the California State Teachers' Retirement System -- the nation's third-largest public pension fund, which lost about $9 million on Homestore shares -- alleges that Homestore boosted revenue through complex third-party transactions involving AOL. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Central District of Los Angeles, doesn't name AOL as a defendant, but it claims that AOL was a party to the transactions.An AOL spokesman said its auditors, Ernst & Young, have reviewed and approved the accounting related to Homestore. A Homestore spokesman declined to comment.The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating AOL for a series of unconventional transactions that occurred in 2000 and 2001, which were highlighted in a series of Washington Post articles last month. One issue in the probe is whether AOL's online division improperly booked revenue from some of its dot-com partners. For example, America Online booked as advertising revenue $27 million that it received from cashing in stock warrants of a small Las Vegas software company called PurchasePro.com Inc. AOL says its accounting was appropriate.Two senior AOL executives, Myer Berlow and David Colburn, already have been questioned by the SEC about AOL's relationship with PurchasePro.

Financial conditions have started to tighten sharply again.Or so says a new financial conditions index produced by a group of academic and Goldman Sachs economists*. And that's important, because financial conditions are a significant determinant of overall economic performance.Financial conditions indexes already exist. In fact there's a plethora that have been developed by investment banks and economic agencies or consultancies. They try to measure the degree to which changes in credit availability, interest rates, risk premia, money supply, wealth effects and other factors are likely to influence future economic activity. Analysis shows they don't work particularly well as predictors of real economic activity.The new index tries to get around these problems by, among other things, broadening the data series included and by trying to strip out the effects of past changes in economic activity that affect the financial variables. In other words, it's looking for evidence of financial shocks rather than the normally dynamics of financial indicators, which tell us plenty about the past but not a lot that's new about the future.Having done that, the new indicator diverges substantially from the existing ones. Established FCIs show that general financial conditions are back to normal or even better than normal. The new index points to a big deterioration during the past quarter, retracing nearly half of last year's big rebound.\n",

Japan found itself uncomfortably in the spotlight today as top officials from the other industrialized countries declared that Tokyo had not done enough to stimulate its economy and help lift its Asian neighbors out of their economic crisis.Emerging from a daylong conference around the corner from Buckingham Palace, finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations said that additional tax cuts and public-works spending would be necessary for Japan to recover from its seven-year economic slump.\"The broadly shared view coming out of our meeting was that it was important for the rest of Asia that Japan once again have strong economic growth,\" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.But Tokyo's new finance minister, Hikaru Matsunaga, adopted a defiant stance following the meeting, where he told his Western counterparts that a recently announced package of financial reforms and limited tax cuts for businesses and investors had not been given a fair hearing nor sufficient time to work.\"I do think the measures that have been taken so far are not too small,\" said Matsunaga, who emphasized that his government has no plans to announce any further steps.\n",

      " THE WASHINGTON POST, SUNDAY, MAY 2 3 , 1 9 8 2. Through the fog of war around the Falklands there emerges glaring evidence as to the ramshackle structure of world politics. Crucial American connections with Britain, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and China seem suddenly to come up for grabs all at once.In this hour of shifting balances, the first requirement is to reassert basic ties. Fortunately, the presidentUas trip to Europe next month offers an occasion for bringing together anew this country, Japan and the Atlantic allies.The Latin American standing of the United States has already been damaged by the fight over the Falklands. In the crunch, the United States sided with Britain against Argentina. While most Latin American countries dislike the Argentines, they are also quick to resent slights from the United States. WashingtonUas tilt away from hemispheric solidarity, and toward an old imperial power, thus adds a new insult to an old injury.No payoff in improved ties with Britain follows. On the contrary, the impartial stance taken by the United States when this country tried to mediate the conflict was seen as a violation of the UIspecial relationshipU that London likes to claim with Washington. If the British emerge from the Falklands any less than triumphant, they will feel, not for the first time, that they were let down by the Yanks.An absence of strong support has already poisoned British relations with the continent. At the outset of the Falklands crisis, BritainUas partners in the European Economic Community unanimously voted sanctions against Argentina. When fighting ensued, the Europeans began having second thoughts. A renewal of the sanctions was voted last MondayUObut only for a week. Harsh words about the Europeans have been spoken by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt have had some nasty things to say about Britain. The United States, once again, is caught in the cross fire.\n",

      " Stock Gyrations Won't Damage Economy --- Experts Say Sharper Drops Are Needed to Cause Tailspin. The lurching stock market may make consumers queasy, but it's going to take more than that to make them sick enough to trigger an economic downturn.Think back to 1987. Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, \"only at some future point\" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R. French, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. Still, a continued stock price plunge in that sector, he said, might reduce its access to venture capital and inhibit initial public offerings.In general, however, the wider economy is largely insulated from the stock market's volatility. True, more \"little guys\" have their money in the stock market today. According Federal Reserve numbers cited by James Poterba, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 38.4% of all U.S.households held some kind of stock in 1992, the latest year for which data are available, up from 33.2% in 1983. But one-third of the $8.4 trillion in corporate public and private equity is tied up in IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, according to 1995 data from the Fed and Investment Company Institute.\n",

      " The Evening Wrap: Paycheck Pressures. Higher energy prices, a lousy housing market and tighter credit continue to put the squeeze on consumers -- and Wal-Mart and Home Depot are feeling their pain.Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. \"Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,\" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. \"It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,\" he said. \"The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been.\" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an \"ebb tide in low-end consumer spending.\" Goldman Sachs faulted \"the tougher macro environment\" for making the company's turnaround \"even tougher to enact,\" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's \"efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season.\" And HSBC's note, echoing Mr. Scott, affirmed that the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle means that, for consumers, \"inflation takes a bite out of real spending growth.\"In that regard, there was a glimmer of good news in economic data released Tuesday. Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports. Bear Stearns analysts wrote that the trade numbers will likely lead the Commerce Department to revise second-quarter economic growth around 4.3% from an originally reported 3.4%.---\n",

      " A Working Thesis: Growth of Labor Force Slows, Raising Hopes Of Lower Jobless Rates --- Trend, if It Holds, May Lead To Greater Productivity; How Women Affect Data --- Baby Boomers Come of Age. The rapid decline in the unemployment rate to 8.4% in November from a postwar high of 10.8% just 11 months earlier has surprised economists and pleased the Reagan administration. But the best news may lie in the future.Analysts see in the recent jobless data signs of a significant change in the growth of the work force. \"We're switching from a decade in which the labor force grew faster than the population to one in which it will grow slower,\" William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Purdue University, says.If this trend holds, the current decade could turn out to be the mirror image of the economically troubled 1970s. The work force exploded in the last decade as women and members of the \"baby boom\" generation sought jobs. \"We had some digestive problems,\" says Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, noting that in the 1970s the jobless rate rose, the rate of growth of worker productivity slowed and inflation soared. But in this decade, \"we may find ourselves able to do more on the employment front without causing an increase in inflation,\" Mr. Bosworth says.Sidney Jones, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, adds, \"After getting ourselves convinced that 6 1/2% is a natural rate of unemployment, it may be that we can do better than that.\"An easing of labor-force growth could have other implications as well. For instance, older workers, who in recent years were pushed out of the labor market by early-retirement plans to make room for younger workers, may find themselves in more demand again. Mr. Dunkelberg believes that the retirement age is likely to rise during the current decade as employers, faced with shortages of new workers, rely on older workers to stay on the job longer.\n",

      " The New Straight Talk. I don't know how many dozen conventional State of the Union speeches it took before I made my basic discovery about the applause that everyone monitors so earnestly during these annual events, reaching conclusions as to party reaction, committee chairman's attitude, chances of passage and so forth. It was that this applause in fact had practically nothing to do with any such considerations, but was a function of something else: The members rose and roared, disrupted the speech with prolonged applause and otherwise loudly indicated their approval precisely and almost exclusively for those pronouncements that they knew to be untrue.Indeed, the more patently untrue, the lustier and more protracted the cheer. The fundamental proposition was always the same: that we could have it all - a stronger defense and more investment in domestic programs, environmental purity and accelerated energy development, lower taxes and increased benefits, etc. We will do this, but not at the expense of that ... the speaker would intone, his voice rising to indicate deep conviction for the wholly implausible second part of the sentence. And the place would go nuts.You do not have to buy all of Bill Clinton's program or to check your view that there was too much of some things, not enough of others, to acknowledge that his Feb. 17 address for the most part crashed through this tradition of mutual dissembling between presidential speaker and congressional audience. Yes, there were some muzzy, unpersuasive moments. But in the main Clinton was saying not that we could have it all, but that we couldn't and that we now had to choose how to get out of the economic predicament that had been talked about mostly by indirection or even covertly in Washington for years.Over those years, the dialogue on the question of the budget deficit and its effect had become ever more tortured, demeaning and involuted - embarrassingly so, I would have thought, for grown men and women. We at The Washington Post, starting back in the early Reagan years, would occasionally be visited (\"off the record\") by prominent Republican legislators and others urging us editorially to help bring about some bipartisan deal wherein big shots of both parties would just sort of close their eyes, hold hands and jump off the cliff together, always with careful provisions to keep one of the parties from cheating and being left standing there on the ledge while the other - poor fool - plummeted into the political abyss. They would talk about ways to frame the thing so that Reagan more or less wouldn't notice or at least wouldn't have the wit to object. They discussed him as if he were the mad uncle in the attic who, unfortunately, still had title to the house.It was unbelievable, now that I think of it, but at the time it seemed only mildly strange. That is because Washington had pretty thoroughly bought into the proposition that some of the things Bill Clinton was to say the other night simply could not be said, not even argued about - too dangerous. People outside this city who complain about the waste of taxpayers' money should, if they want to get even madder, merely contemplate how much they paid out in both executive and legislative branch salaries over the decades to people who gave over hours and days and weeks of paid time to fussing about who would or wouldn't get the blame for saying aloud what they were all whispering among themselves.\n",

As one of the region's most prosperous jurisdictions, Arlington was well positioned to ride out the recession, they said.But with the county entering a fifth consecutive budget season facing a large revenue shortfall, that brand of optimism has begun to wane. Increasingly, county officials are acknowledging that they face a long-term case of the fiscal blahs, in which annual increases in the property tax rate and mild program cuts will continue to be the rule.\"There is going to be no great recovery from the recession, which we've been counting on for several years,\" said Mark Jinks, the county's director of management and finance. \"There's a recognition on the board's part that things have to get in line.\"On Saturday, Arlington County Board members received a continuing run of gloomy fiscal news that began in 1990, after a regional real estate boom came to an abrupt halt.

      " Japan Surplus On Trade Rose In December. TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus grew a greater-than-expected 14% in December, including a 23% expansion in the surplus with the U.S. that could worsen trade tensions between the two countries.Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose to 1.415 trillion yen ($12.36 billion) on a customs-cleared basis in December from 1.237 trillion yen a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. The December figures reversed a narrowing of 16% in the trade surplus in November, and set the country's surplus growing again for the 20th time in the past 21 months.For all of 1998, Japan's trade surplus expanded 40% to 13.985 trillion yen, while the surplus with the U.S. grew 33% to 6.697 trillion yen, the ministry said. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia shrank 36% last year to 3.977 trillion yen.In December, Japan's overall exports fell 12% to 4.130 trillion yen. But in a continuation of a pattern that has pushed Japan's surplus steadily higher since Asia's economic crisis hit, imports fell even faster, declining 22% to 2.715 trillion yen. On the import side, it was the steepest monthly drop in 12 years. Exports to the U.S. fell 6.1% to 1.175 trillion yen, while imports from the U.S. fell 25% to 578 billion yen, bringing Japan's surplus for the month to 597.26 billion yen.Japan's surplus could expand further if the country's weak economy continues to overwhelm the boost a strengthening yen usually gives to imports. A stronger yen tends to make imports more appealing because they cost less in yen terms. Still, in December, the drop in imports came despite an increase in the yen's value to an average of 119.91 per dollar in December from 128.18 yen per dollar the previous December.\n",

The unnerving spectacle of the stock market shedding almost a fifth of its value in less than two months might be expected to cool the enthusiasm of \"privatizers\" who want to give Americans the power to invest their Social Security funds in stocks.

Eighteen months after a wrong-way bet on interest rates led to $1.7 billion in losses, California's Orange County is emerging from historic bankruptcy proceedings with fewer delays and less economic pain than many had feared.Not only has the county's business climate improved dramatically despite going through the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy, but investors today are expected to snap up nearly $900 million of new debt being issued by the county. How was the crisis solved so quickly? And what lessons does it hold for fiscally struggling county and city governments nationwide?According to county officials and advisers, the speedy resolution was a combination of luck, innovative financing, hard-nosed bargaining with creditors and state legislation that allowed the nation's fifth most-populous county to avoid the gloomy scenario predicted a few months ago.The roughly $880 million note and bond sale will hit the market just as Wall Street underwriters are hungry for business and investors are eager to buy riskier, lower-rated securities, which carry relatively high yields.

      " The Federal Reserve: From Central Bank to Central Planner. Momentous changes are under way in what central banks are and what they do. We are used to thinking that central banks' main task is to guide the economy by setting interest rates. Central banks' main tools used to be \"open-market\" operations, i.e. purchasing short-term Treasury debt, and short-term lending to banks.Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Federal Reserve has intervened in a wide variety of markets, including commercial paper, mortgages and long-term Treasury debt. At the height of the crisis, the Fed lent directly to teetering nonbank institutions, such as insurance giant AIG, and participated in several shotgun marriages, most notably between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.These \"nontraditional\" interventions are not going away anytime soon. Many Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, see \"credit constraints\" and \"segmented markets\" throughout the economy, which the Fed's standard tools don't address. Moreover, interest rates near zero have rendered those tools nearly powerless, so the Fed will naturally search for bigger guns. In his speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke made it clear that \"we should not rule out the further use of such [nontraditional] policies if economic conditions warrant.\"But the Fed has crossed a bright line. Open-market operations do not have direct fiscal consequences, or directly allocate credit. That was the price of the Fed's independence, allowing it to do one thing -- conduct monetary policy -- without short-term political pressure. But an agency that allocates credit to specific markets and institutions, or buys assets that expose taxpayers to risks, cannot stay independent of elected, and accountable, officials.In addition, the Fed is now a gargantuan financial regulator. Its inspectors examine too-big-to-fail banks, come up with creative \"stress tests\" for them to pass, and haggle over thousands of pages of regulation. When we think of the Fed 10 years from now, on current trends, we're likely to think of it as financial czar first, with monetary policy the boring backwater.\n",

      " Rosy Goes to Toronto. Forget the economic summit that just concluded here and turn your attention to the one that will count-in France in 1989: they had to hold this one because it is an annual event.For President Reagan, the Toronto summit provided a convenient backdrop of nostalgia and looking back. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher-Reagan's closest ideological partner-pronounced her blessing, as a spokesman for her put it, by crediting Reagan for moving the world away \"from the locomotive theory to prudent economic theory.\" That means, he said, that a policy \"of throwing money\" at problems has been abandoned.The mutual admiration society apart, the president and the other heads of government said they are content with the current short-term outlook, and chose not to rock the boat by dwelling on the medium- and long-term issues. So the main product of the Toronto summit was a global \"Rosy Scenario.\"But in private conversations, lesser officials were not kidding themselves: they know that the hard problems, not discussed here, have been swept under the rug until next year, when there will be a new American president.\"At the 1989 summit, you will have the key new participant-either Bush or Dukakis,\" said a Canadian official. \"And Bush or Dukakis will have to face all of the big issues-the American budget deficit, trade imbalances, Third World debt and these huge farm subsidies.\"\n",

      " Capital and Marks-ism. Capitalism, n Formerly, a system in which money was invested in the future production of goods. Increasingly a system in which money is invested in the future of money.The most revealing aspect of last week's currency chaos is the entirely reasonable assumption by the media that nobody understood it. Primers and Q&A's festooned front-pages of papers that claim the nation's most sophisticated readership, not only to analyze the consequences of the strong German mark and determine their implications, but to explain-or try to-what in the world was happening.Today, men everywhere praise capitalism-at least those men surrounded by material goods. But last week's crisis suggests that, just as few people in the country seems to know much history, science or culture, the mechanisms of modern capitalism are widely misunderstood and that this is a field much dependent on faith: You put money in the bank, and after that, all is currency transubstantiation.And why not? Capital activity now threatens to attain the unknowable. ECUS, ERMs, shorts, leveraged bets, \"one-lots,\" \"lining up,\" \"front-running,\" hedges and futures seem less the language of business than the stuff of exchange eschatology. One account of the week's money mess actually included the language: \"The central bankers propose, the markets dispose.\" No one tried to comfort the losers in last week's debacle by reminding them that the market works in mysterious ways, at least not in so many words.Cows, n. Friendly beasts with a suggestive set of associations: At once the symbol of wealth (when fattened), of false faith (when golden) and of bovine stupidity.\n",

      " Are Some Banks Really Too Big To Fail?: Regulators' Answer: Maybe Yes, Maybe No. On July 4,1982, leading bank regulators met at the Federal Reserve to decide whether the failure of a little-known bank in an Oklahoma shopping mall would break the U.S. financial system.Paul Volcker, then Federal Reserve chairman, feared that it could because the largest deposits in the bankUOthose over $100,000UO were not fully covered by federal deposit insurance. Fearing that losses and panic could spread to other banks, Volcker favored a federal rescue plan. He said that to do otherwise risked disrupting commercial transactions, causing Depression-style lines at banks and undermining faith in the financial system.William M. Isaac, then chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., wanted to let the bank fail, to show that the sort of abuses that ruined the Oklahoma bank would not be patched up by federal assistance.

Now, as the 1996 stock car racing season heads into its final turn, JarrettUas only concerns are about what he will winUOnot what he might lose.Less than a year removed from wondering what car he would be driving, Jarrett is in position to become only the second driver ever to win a $1 million bonus for winning three of stock car racingUas four \"crown jewels.U That does not include Jarrett's victory in the prestigious Brickyard 400 earlier this monthUOa race many drivers consider the sport's second biggest of the year.

When Jarrett struggled with one of the best teams in the business and Irvan returned late in the season from near-fatal injuries, JarrettUas future was in limbo. Like many other drivers . with one-year contracts, Jarrett was expendable.But Yates,.regarded as one of the sportUas premier owners, decided to begin a second team, and he retained Jarrett to drive it with another one-year contract for the 1996 season.

With his popularity slowly eroding as the nation's unemployment rate has risen, President Obama spent Friday reassuring people in Pennsylvania's struggling Lehigh Valley that his administration is focused on stemming the nation's jobs crisis.The visit here marked the start of what the White House is calling a Main Street tour, aimed at connecting the president's economic policies to workaday Americans, many of whom feel like they have yet to benefit from them.One day after hosting a high-profile jobs forum at the White House, Obama traveled here to visit a job training center and a local pet food plant and to hold a town hall meeting at Lehigh Carbon Community College to discuss his ideas for stemming unemployment and growing the economy.During his remarks at the college, Obama struck a populist theme, telling several hundred people packed into a gymnasium that all of his economic policies -- from the financial and auto bailouts to health-care reform -- are aimed at stabilizing the economy and creating jobs. \"I didn't [undertake] them because they were popular or gratifying -- they weren't. . . . But I did them because they were necessary to save our country from an even greater catastrophe,\" he said.Obama also said that he planned to summon the nation's top bankers back to the White House this month to press them to loosen credit for small-business owners and others on the front lines of job creation. \"And part of what our message to the banks is, the taxpayers were there for you to clean up your mistakes,\" he said. \"You now have a responsibility to be there for the community now that we're bearing the brunt of a lot of these problems that you caused.\"\n",

Yahoo Inc. said third-quarter profit more than tripled and revenue more than doubled, helped by continued growth in search-related advertising and the effect of acquisitions, and raised its financial forecast for the fourth quarter.The Sunnyvale, Calif., Internet company said net income rose to $253 million, or 17 cents a share, from $65 million, or five cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $907 million from $357 million, in part because of acquisitions.More than half of Yahoo's net income came from the sale of a portion of its stake in rival Google Inc., following Google's August initial public offering. Yahoo said the sale of Google shares and related tax benefits boosted the bottom line by $129 million. Without the gain, Yahoo's per-share earnings would have been in line with the nine cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson First Call.The results exceeded Yahoo's own forecast. Excluding commissions paid to marketing partners, Yahoo reported revenue of $655 million. The company had projected revenue on that basis of $610 million to $650 million.Yahoo's results demonstrate continued growth in Internet-related commerce, even as more established technology companies struggled with a summer slowdown. They likely augur similarly strong results when Google reports for the first time as a public company next week.\n",

      " Leading the News: AIG's Extra Reserves Spook Rivals --- Added $2.8 Billion Hurts Stock, May Spur Insurers To Review Claims Exposure. American International Group Inc.'s announcement of a $2.8 billion increase to its insurance claims reserves sent shivers through the markets yesterday and rattled a property-casualty insurance industry that already has added more than $7 billion to its reserves this year.As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AIG shares sagged $3.63, or 6.6%, to $51.70.AIG's announcement, made late Monday, is the latest in a series of hits taken by the industry. The bulk of earlier reserve additions, however, have been related to lingering asbestos liabilities and claims from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. AIG's new reserves, linked to business written between 1997 and 2001, are for a broader array of policies, and thus the announcement is expected to prompt other insurers to once again re-evaluate the adequacy of their own reserves.\"This is an indictment of the entire industry's balance sheet,\" said William Yankus, a property-casualty analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. The question being asked now is this, Mr. Yankus said: If AIG's underwriting wasn't adequate, how bad are the problems at other companies?Another big property-casualty insurer, Chubb Corp., said yesterday it was taking a charge of $100 million related to its reserves for European directors-and-officers liability business. At the same time, Chubb said its net income for the fourth quarter was $56.6 million, or 33 cents a share, roughly double the $28.7 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Chubb shares were down $2.97, or 5.4%, to $51.60 on the Big Board.\n",

Sedate and scholarly Dr. Arthur Burns, the ex-Columbia professor, now chief of Presi dent EisenhowerUas Council of Economic A d -j visers, went to great pains in explaining to Senators why he had to testify about business recession in secret.Dr- Burns, appearing before _ the Joint Committee on the = Economic Report, explained | = that he had been searching his E soul as to whether to testify at'Si all. The way he looked at it. he had a confidential relationship with the President. However, he had given the matter deep thought. Since Cabinet officers are expected to testify, Burns decided he, too. had an obliga tion to appear before Congress if requested. However, he had to insist that no transcript be taken of his remarks of native troops. Radford proposes sending a top United States military man, with experience in either Greece or Korea, to train Indo-Chinese natives.This would save French lives, and, he believes, would result in some real resistance against the Chinese-equipped Communists who' since the end of the Korean war have received trainload after trainload of munitions, obviously diverted from the Korean front.Sen. Paul Douglas (D-I1L), an ex-professor of economics at the University of Chicago, promptly challenged him. Burns then went into a lengthy explanation, pointing out that in speaking off-the-cuff, he was apt to oversimplify a complex situation or to state an idea more positively than it ought to be expressed. Therefore, he preferred to keep his remarkg informal. If a transcript were made, he said, it would make his testimony appear more formal than it actually would be.There was also the possibility, he continued, that he might say something that would appear to be in contradiction of . the PresidentUas Economic Report. He hastened to assure that he didnUat mean he disagreed with the PresidentUas report in any detail.

      " Institutional Stock Market Commissions Seem to Be Leveling Off After Long Fall. NEW YORK -- Institutional stock market commissions, which fell steadily for a decade after deregulation in 1975, finally appear to be leveling off.Money managers are paying an average 7.2 cents a share for their stock market trades, according to a recent survey by SEI Corp., a Wayne, Pa., pension consultant. That's nearly level with the 7.3 cents a share a year earlier, SEI says. By contrast, institutional commissions averaged 10.4 cents a share in 1979 and 25 cents a share in 1975.\"I think institutions realize that if they keep squeezing prices down, the service they get from brokers will be squeezed too,\" says Gil Beebower, an SEI senior vice president. In particular, he says, lower commissions would hurt brokers' ability to provide stock market research or to handle difficult trades.Meanwhile, securities firms welcome the break in commission price-cutting. \"We aren't at all unhappy,\" says Brian Barefoot, director of global broker-dealer operations at Merrill Lynch & Co. He says that the profitability of Merrill's institutional equity operations is \"up fairly significantly from last year\" and that steady commission rates seem to be benefiting other securities firms as well.Cheaper commissions, of course, have been a major factor in surging stock market volume. In 1986, New York Stock Exchange daily trading averaged 140 million shares, compared with less than 40 million shares a day in 1979 and less than 20 million shares in the early 1970s. With average commissions at slightly more than seven cents a share, institutions and other major investors are able to trade more frequently, at lower cost.\n",

      " Japanese House Approves Overhaul in Tax Laws; Goals of Reform, First in 40 Years, Are Fairness and Stimulation of Economy. The lower house of Japan's parliament today approved the first major overhaul of the country's tax laws in nearly 40 years, a major victory for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose government has been plagued by an insider-trading scandal.The tax plan, which is intended to modernize a system put in place by the U.S. occupation in 1949, would lower and simplify income tax rates, reduce corporate tax rates and impose an across-the-board indirect sales tax-similar to a value-added tax-of 3 percent. The reform is intended to make taxation fairer and, in the short term, stimulate Japan's economy, although many Japanese fear it represents the first step toward higher taxes.The six bills that make up the tax plan now move to the upper house, where the government is expected to prevail again.Takeshita's trademark style of plodding, behind-the-scenes negotiation paid off, as his factionalized party stood firm behind the plan and the opposition allowed the debate and vote to take place without disruption or delaying tactics. Two previous prime ministers, including Takeshita's predecessor Yasuhiro Nakasone, had failed in their efforts to push similar measures through the Diet, as the Japanese parliament is known.Takeshita, who has been in office a little more than a year, has called tax reform his top domestic priority. He could have bulldozed it through, relying just on the ruling party majority in the Diet. But Takeshita did not want to open his Cabinet to accusations of \"tyranny by majority,\" a grave sin in consensus-conscious Japan.\n",

      " Fed's Credit Easing and Dollar's Fall Are Expected to Yield Mixed Results. NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's abrupt credit easing and the dollar's sharp fall will help avert a recession next year, according to many economists and investment managers. But they also predict that inflation and interest rates will rebound next year.Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, interest rates have tumbled more than 1 1/2 percentage points as the Federal Reserve suddenly opened the monetary spigot in an effort to calm the financial markets. Last week, the Reagan administration emphasized that its top priority is to prevent a recession, even if that means a lower dollar.These policies may only provide \"a respite\" for the credit markets, says John Paulus, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co. \"This is a strategy to avoid serious action on (cutting) the budget deficit while liquifying our way past a recession. The Republicans are whistling past the graveyard by doing nothing.\"Radford Rigsby, a portfolio manager for the Harvard Management Co., says he is \"very cynical\" about the recent bond market rally and remains concerned about the long-term inflation outlook. Although the dollar already has declined as much as 7% against most major currencies during the past three weeks, \"we may have to wait until the end of 1988 before we see a big rise in inflation,\" he says.\"I own a lot of bonds right now, but I'm not sure how much longer I'll hold on.

      " Plan B for AIG. The survival of a great American business may now depend on whether private investors will be allowed to succeed where government seems to be failing. We're referring to insurance giant AIG, which under the terms of a federal bailout is threatening to become a loser for taxpayers. Maybe it's time for the feds to consider Plan B.With its September 16 rescue of the world's largest insurer, the New York Federal Reserve has managed to put taxpayers on the hook for more than $120 billion, but on terms so onerous that AIG may have to be sold in pieces at firesale prices. Most of the taxpayer exposure comes from an $85 billion revolving credit facility, in return for the government taking almost 80% of AIG's equity.The Feds are charging AIG more than 10% interest on the entire $85 billion, even if the company doesn't borrow that much. The interest rate on money actually borrowed is more than 14%. One AIG shareholder likens it to a financial counselor advising someone struggling to pay the 6% interest on his mortgage to solve the problem by running up debt on his credit card. That's why the New York Federal Reserve recently had to bail out the bailout, lending another $37.8 billion at more attractive terms.But the first transaction is still crushing the company, forcing a virtual liquidation. According to a source familiar with the company, AIG is suffering declines in renewals among corporate customers as it loses business to competitors. An AIG spokesman says, \"Renewals worldwide are strong, but there are variations depending on the region and line of business.\" No one disputes, however, that interim CEO Ed Liddy's job is not so much to run the business as to prepare various AIG subsidiaries for quick and dirty sale, though there's no guarantee that the prices he gets will protect taxpayers from losses.We have little sympathy for a company that sought government assistance, except that in this case shareholders were never permitted to vote on the deal. The shareholder with the largest stake, former CEO Hank Greenberg, says the firm would have been better off in Chapter 11. AIG directors instead had every incentive to choose a transaction with the government -- even on horrible terms -- over bankruptcy. That's because a bankruptcy filing would have stripped directors of legal protection.\n",

      " Ford Workers Sue Concern, UAW Over Benefits for Unemployment. Thousands of current and former Ford Motor Co. workers in Kentucky have taken the company and the United Auto Workers to court to recoup millions of dollars in allegedly unpaid unemployment benefits.The trial, which began last week in Louisville federal court, comes nearly 10 years after workers sued Ford claiming it neglected to pay them supplemental unemployment funds during layoffs in the early 1980s. Plaintiffs' attorneys say Ford owes the workers $14 million in benefits plus interest -- a total of more than $35 million.According to their 1982 complaint, the approximately 2,000 workers were entitled, under a union contract, to 95% of their after-tax weekly pay for a specified period of time during layoffs. The company was obligated to supplement state and federal unemployment benefits so that workers would receive that amount. But in the early 1980s, when workers from a Ford plant in Jefferson County, Ky., tried to collect their supplemental benefits called \"SUB\" funds, Ford didn't have sufficient funds, the workers allege.The workers claimed in their suit, which has been certified as a class action, that the company had mistakenly paid more than $250 million in supplemental unemployment funds to another group of Kentucky workers who were entitled to supplemental funding from a federal benefit called the Trade Readjustment Allowance or TRA. Some of those workers were getting up to 150% of their take-home pay during layoffs.Ford's SUB fund was able to recoup about $138 million of the $250 million through paycheck deductions from workers who later returned to their jobs, according to Charles Zimmerman, one of the attorneys for the allegedly underpaid workers.\n",

      " The Afternoon Report: Killing Merck's Pain?. Drug maker Merck is hoping it can reenter a lucrative market for arthritis painkillers, but comments from regulators today suggest it faces long odds, just as a number of analysts suspected.Merck's Arcoxia, like the company's shelved Vioxx, is a Cox-2 inhibitor, designed to reduce the gastrointestinal damage that other painkillers may cause. However, The Food and Drug Administration said in a memo posted on its Web site that new drugs in that class should fill an unmet medical need for patients who have no other \"relatively safer\" means to manage their arthritis pain. The agency also noted that it \"remains uncertain\" as to whether most Cox-2 drugs deliver their purported gastrointestinal benefits -- it said only Pfizer's Celebrex, which remains on the market, has been shown to reduce bleeding. Vioxx was yanked off the market in 2004 after it was linked to increased cardiovascular risks, and Merck soon found itself facing thousands of lawsuits from consumers. (The drug maker has vowed to fight each claim, and it has had a mixed record in state and federal trials so far.) Under great political pressure, the FDA put \"black box\" warnings on Cox-2 inhibitors in 2005. Since then, Merck has been looking for a way to recover at least some of the $2.5 billion in annual sales Vioxx produced in 2003, its last full year on the market.An outside panel of medical experts will vote Thursday on whether they think Arcoxia, which is already being sold by Merck overseas but fetched relatively small sales of just $265 million last year, should be given the green light by the FDA. The agency isn't bound to follow the experts' advice, though it frequently does. Many Wall Street analysts believe that Arcoxia's chances for approval are slim. Jason Napodano of Zack's Equity Research sees \"a near-term U.S. launch of Arcoxia as highly unlikely.\" He thinks that regulators, who took a lot of heat over their approval of Vioxx and other Cox-2 inhibitors after word of the heart risks emerged, will be ill-inclined to stick their necks out on the drugs this time. \"We believe the FDA would be highly criticized for approving Arcoxia given the past cardiovascular risks seen with the class and the new hypertension and edema risks\" shown in a trial of the drug, Mr. Napodano noted. Many analysts aren't even bothering to build Arcoxia into their projections for Merck.Merck remains upbeat about its outlook and even recently bumped up its profit estimates for this year. Though it's eager to replace its lost Vioxx sales, the drug giant isn't putting all of its eggs in one basket. It boasts a strong roster of newer drugs which should help to offset the large piles of cash that the company is shoveling into Vioxx litigation, as well as the loss of patent protection on the blockbuster cholesterol fighter Zocor. Among those medications is Gardasil, a vaccine for the cervical-cancer causing human papillomavirus. Merck ditched a much-criticized campaign to make Gardasil vaccinations mandatory for young girls, but Mr. Napodano thinks that it \"will be a blockbuster for Merck\" anyway. Wall Street also has high hopes for just-approved diabetes drug Janumet. Jami Rubin of Morgan Stanley, who lifted her price target on Merck from $53 to $55 today, projects it will fetch $2.8 billion in sales by 2011. Merck, which reports earnings next week, saw it shares rise slightly today, to around $46 a share, just shy of its 52-week high of $46.55.---\n",

      " Study Links U.S. Deficit, Third World: Growth Seen as Aid To Domestic Economy. The U.S. trade deficit could be substantially reduced if the Third World debt crisis is defused sufficiently to allow middle-income developing countries to become important customers for American products again.That is a central conclusion of a new policy study by the Overseas Development Council, a local think tank devoted to debt and development issues in less advanced nations.The report argues that the next U.S. president will be faced not only with the tough assignment of restoring the United StatesUa domestic strength, but with fundamental changes that now bind America's future inextricably \"with the progress of the developing countries.\"It also contends that for the longer run, policymakers in both the rich and poor nations must deal with the potential impact of an impending \"third industrial revolution,\" based on new and complex technologies that will be more difficult for the poorer nations to introduce and manage. That could further harm many Third World countries, \"an outcome that would not be in either the economic or political interests of the United States,U the report says.The ODC study, edited by ODC President John W. Sewell and project director Stuart K. Tucker, acknowledges that under any set of assumptions and circumstances, UIthe [U.S.J trade deficit will not disappear quickly.\" But it suggests that if the growth rate in the Third World can be expanded from currently projected levels of less than 3 percent to 6 percent, an additional $32 billion might be lopped off the U.S. trade deficit by 1992.\n",

      " Fallout From Credit Crunch Creates Another One. After improving in September and early October, markets in a wide variety of debt -- including for home mortgages, consumer loans, and corporate buyouts -- have sharply deteriorated in recent weeks. Investors view much of this debt as riskier than they did even at the height of the August credit crisis and are requiring higher interest rates as compensation.While markets are behaving in a more orderly fashion than they were in August, many on Wall Street fear that the situation will get worse before it gets better. \"This is just dragging on longer,\" said Axel Merk, a portfolio manager for Merk Hard Currency Fund. \"We're very early in this.\"Economists increasingly worry that banks are suffering such massive losses that they will be forced to cut back their lending to consumers and businesses. That would slow the economy, much as the savings and loan crisis did in the early 1990s. Yesterday, an analyst predicted that Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, would suffer another $15 billion in losses in the coming six months from its exposure to exotic types of debt.That prediction, along with fresh negative data about the housing market, drove the Dow Jones industrial average down 218 points, or 1.7 percent. Financial markets are pointing to a strong possibility of even more bad news.For example, futures markets indicate that there is a 20 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by half a percentage point or more at its next policy meeting Dec. 11, even though it is widely understood that the central bank would do so only if there were highly negative economic news between now and then. An index measuring the cost of insuring against credit losses on 125 financially sound companies reached an all-time high yesterday. And the market for securities backed by commercial real estate loans, which had been little affected through the August crunch, is showing strain.\n",

      " The Case of the Missing Workers. The job market recovery continues, sort of, though what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other. In Friday's Labor Department report for November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7% from 7.9% in October, but mainly because another 350,000 workers disappeared during the month.Call it the case of the missing workers. In the last year, employers have added an average of about 150,000 workers a month. In November they added 146,000, less 49,000 in downward revisions for the previous two months. Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand? One popular suspect last month is Hurricane Sandy, yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded that the storm \"did not substantially impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November.\"\n",

      " Bond Prices Decline in Sluggish Trading As Some Short-Term Interest Rates Rise. NEW YORK -- Bond prices drifted lower in sluggish trading yesterday as some important short-term interest rates climbed.The federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans of reserves among banks, hovered between about 7 3/4% and 7 7/8% most of the day. That was up from Friday's average of 7.61% and was slightly higher than some traders expected.Prices of some long-term U.S. government bonds fell by about 3/8 of a point, or around $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Dealers said trading volume was light mainly because of continued confusion about the economic outlook.Several major government economic reports are scheduled to be released this week, including one today on retail sales for July. The average forecast of 16 analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report showed an increase of 0.1% in retail sales, compared with June's 0.8% decline. But a few analysts expect the report to show a large drop, which they say will convince more investors that the economy remains lethargic and that interest rates will decline further.Bankers Trust Co., in its \"Key Indicator Forecasts\" report, estimated that retail sales last month tumbled \"as much as 2%\" from June's level. Such a decline would be caused mainly by sluggish car sales, the report said. Also, general merchandise sales \"remained sluggish in July, according to what we hear from market sources,\" the report said.\n",

      " Fiscal Cliff's Edge Drawing Close in U.S.. New Year's Eve dawned with no solution to Washington's budget impasse, setting up a 24-hour scramble to determine whether lawmakers could do what they've promised for months: engineer an alternative to the so-called fiscal cliff.What happens Monday could go some way to determining the short-term fate of the U.S. economy and the reputation of the government, both of which have been dinged by the spectacle of endless seemingly circular negotiations.Carrying the baton late into Sunday evening were Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Vice President Joe Biden. A spokesman for Mr. McConnell said Monday morning that the two men \"will continue to work toward a solution.\" In the past two weeks, at least three different sets of negotiation teams have sought a way out.On taxes, one of the thorniest issues on the table, the two sides appeared to be converging. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for raising individual income-tax rates on family income above $250,000. In the latest round of Senate talks, Republicans proposed a $550,000 threshold, which Democrats moved to $450,000, according to Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).On the estate tax, Democrats are no longer insisting on an increased rate and instead have agreed to put the matter to a separate vote, which suggests current rates will likely continue. That's a concession to the GOP and a number of farm-state Democrats in the Senate. Absent action, rates on estates will jump and the threshold at which they would hit is set to fall.\n",

      " One Sure Fact: Baby Boomers Are Aging --- But Forecasters Dispute Impact On Economy. The baby boom, which has confounded forecasters since it was conceived, is at it again.The latest confusion stems from the middle-aging of the baby boomers. The first boomers turned 40 in 1986, and another four million or so will cross that threshold each year through 2004.Many prognosticators are absolutely certain this means something significant to business and the U.S. economy. They disagree, however, on what that something is. Will the aging of the baby boom lead to a surge in consumer spending? A flood of savings? A drop in demand for houses?\"Marketers have been in love with the baby boom for years now,\" says Judy Langer, a New York marketing consultant. \"They have come to realize that people who are 40 aren't dead. The feeling is very much that it will be a very good market.\" But, she adds, \"People don't know exactly where the boomers are headed.\"To a large extent, the economic direction of maturing baby boomers will depend on whether they behave as their parents did at the same age. So far, there isn't enough evidence to tell. Here's some of the thinking among baby-boom watchers in three major areas of uncertainty:\n",

      " Intrinsic value: New recipe for the GDP leaves sour taste. Anyone who listens to economists knows the U.S. economy has been doing pretty well, with productivity booming, capital spending on a tear, and cost pressures modest. This is the payback for laying off all those workers. The poor souls may be out of jobs, but look how lean and mean everyone else is.Except that now the Commerce Department has changed its mind. It has cooked up -- just what you were waiting for -- a new way of calculating the gross domestic product.Breathless as you may be for the math, it's the result that matters. The government (assuming it ever reopens) is about to air-brush its old GDP numbers, and in the process reverse much of the evidence for formerly well-accepted economic trends.Growth will suddenly shrink by a half percentage point a year or more. In a $7 trillion economy, that's a lot of shrinkage. What's more, the \"productivity revolution\" will vanish into some storage cellar of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or wherever they wind up stashing the old numbers.Productivity -- output per worker -- was rising in the '90s at 2.2% a year, more than double the rate of the '70s and '80s. Under Commerce's new math, the figure for the '90s will be only 1.4% -- now nearly identical to prior eras.\n",

      " Senate Debates Priorities For `Peace Dividend'; Measures Indicate Political Nature of Issue. The Senate asked itself yesterday whether it wants to use any \"peace dividend\" to reduce deficits, increase spending or cut taxes. The answer was yes.In the opening of what is expected to be a long, contentious and highly political debate on the issue, the Senate indicated in two nonbinding resolutions that its first priority is deficit reduction and that it puts spending on \"urgent national priorities\" only barely ahead of tax cuts.But mainly, yesterday's votes demonstrated that the issue is far from resolved and underscored the political opportunities and hazards that face both Democrats and Republicans as they attempt to deal with the fiscal fallout from peace and reap the political rewards.The debate signaled agreement among many conservatives as well as liberals that there will be at least some peace dividend, although probably relatively small at the start, as easing of East-West tensions causes reductions in military spending. But there was little agreement on the size of the windfall, and the Senate came perilously close to saying it should be used for everything.The early test of wills on the peace dividend issue began when Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) proposed a \"sense of the Senate\" amendment urging that any savings left after deficit reduction targets are met be \"returned to America's taxpayers\" in the form of tax cuts.\n",

      " Cysive to Lay Off 40 to 50 Workers; Restructuring to Cost Up to $8 Million. Cysive Inc., a Reston Internet consulting firm, yesterday announced its plan to lay off workers for the first time in its seven- year history and lowered projections for its revenue and earnings in the quarter that ends Dec. 31.The company expects to cut 40 to 50 non-engineers, or 13 percent to 16 percent of its staff. Cysive also will freeze additional hiring, company officials said.The layoffs are part of a broader restructuring effort that will cost Cysive up to $8 million before taxes. Between $1 million and $2 million will go toward severance pay, the rest toward bad debt and real estate restructuring.Cysive, which customizes software systems, is reeling from cancellations, delays and spending freezes among some of its customers. In August the company dropped its largest customer in a payment dispute and said it would forgo nearly $4 million in revenue in the third quarter and another $1.5 million this quarter. At least one Cysive client could possibly file for bankruptcy protection, Cysive officials said yesterday in response to questioning from analysts.As a result, the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue expectations to $9 million from $14 million. It dropped its projections for net income to a loss of 10 to 12 cents per share, before the restructuring charges, compared with the loss of 2 to 3 cents per share expected only a few weeks earlier.\n",

      " Low-Cost Clinics: Best Way to Treat Substance Abuse. If sensible treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism were to be offered in every U.S. neighborhood, it also could improve the health of some people who have never touched drugs or taken a drink, and do this more dramatically than any research now in progress. It also could lower medical-care costs more effectively than will all the arbitrary cost-cutting that is now shaving most everyone's medical care down to the grimly skinny. The overdue task is to properly define what sensible substance-abuse treatment is.Given the current obsession with controlling medical-care costs, what's sensible should bear some relation to what's affordable. Yet at the most publicized of alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment centers, the Fair Oaks hospital group (which sponsors the famous 800-COCAINE hotline), the current cost of a hospital day is $1,000, which exceeds the price of a day in the coronary-care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital. The cost of a full inpatient term of treatment at these centers -- four weeks to six months -- ranges from $28,000 to $160,000, with an average of $56,000. This is a spread whose lower end is higher than the cost of bypass surgery and all its attendant expense and whose upper end is more than double the average cost -- $70,000 -- of treating an AIDS patient. Most other middle-class centers cost $10,000 per term of inpatient treatment, while the Betty Ford Center charges $5,000, and Hazelden in Minnesota charges $4,000.The reason no one questions these prices, not even the insurance companies who pay them, is that the alternative expense in addiction-related disease, lost productivity and crime is reckoned at $170 billion a year. With treatment success rates reported as high as 85% to 92% at (for instance) the Fair Oaks hospital group, the treatment prices have appeared eminently cost-effective, and the success rates miles ahead of those recorded over the past 50 years by public substance-abuse programs. The hitch, according to Dr. Chad Emrick of the University of Colorado (the only researcher to review all the literature on this subject), is that those success rates are more fantasy than fact. Both Dr. Emrick and Dr. George Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School, say that, even when addressed in these same expensive treatment centers, alcoholism and drug abuse remain notoriously prone to relapse -- which confuses the meaning of \"success.\" Many of those treated need retreatment two or three or more times.Given prices of $160,000 or $56,000 or even $4,000 per term of treatment, how can we afford care for those who are habitual and excessive users of drugs and/or alcohol? There are an estimated 40 million people who regularly abuse these substances. Were all of them to be treated only once at even the lowest-priced outpatient center (Hazelden, at $1,800 per term of treatment) the cost would be on the order of $72 billion. That's one-fifth of annual current medical expenses in the U.S. If, against high odds, half of these heavy users could break their habits by themselves, the remainder would still cost some $36 billion to treat -- once. What is the answer?To begin with, Drs. Emrick and Vaillant and others have not found a scintilla of evidence to show that expensive treatment works any more effectively than less expensive kinds. Mr. Vaillant, author of the classic book \"The Natural History of Alcoholism,\" says, \"What's important is that treatment be available for everyone as often as they need it.\" On just this precept, the Cambridge and Somerville Program for Alcohol Recovery in Massachusetts, developed by Harvard Medical School physicians, has for the past 16 years treated about 20,000 patients a year at an annual cost of $1 million. Its bywords are easy accessibility and versatility of approach. The program includes a 24-hour walk-in clinic, outpatient groups, groups for families, women's groups, a detoxification unit and three halfway houses. It boasts no amazing statistics or new wonder therapies, but in its humdrum and unpretentious way it weans a great many people from their injurious addictions, some permanently, others only for a while at a time. Its \"success\" rate, in short, is as good as any.\n",

      " Travel Downturn Spreads More Woes --- A Community of Immigrants In Shadow of LAX Suffers Loss of Thousands of Jobs. LENNOX, CALIF. -- Something strange washed over this area following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11: quiet.With planes grounded across the U.S., residents of this crowded community abutting Los Angeles airport weren't assaulted by the sound of jet engines for the first time in anybody's memory. The sudden silence was so at odds with the usual deafening roar that \"kids were scared\" by it, says Maria Van Deventer, assistant principal at Jefferson Elementary School.Today, planes are once again buzzing just 300 feet above the heads of the people of Lennox. But something even scarier has befallen them. The meltdown in the travel and tourism business has claimed thousands of their jobs.As much as any place in America, this 1.3-square-mile unincorporated area of Los Angeles County has been the victim of post-Sept. 11 economic fallout. Because this is practically a company town, with many of its 23,000 residents employed at the third busiest airport in the world and related businesses, Lennox has become a ground zero of sorts for the devastated travel and tourism industry.The impact of the near collapse in the industry has left a broad footprint. Airline industry revenue should decline 30% in the fourth quarter over the year-earlier period, estimates Kevin C.

      " The Crisis Is Global. We should not fool ourselves that the recent sell-offs in world stock markets simply reflect a nervous reaction to Russia's turmoil or a long-overdue \"correction.\" They signify instead a gathering fear that the global economy is drifting toward a dangerous slump, driven by forces that world leaders only vaguely understand and seem powerless to affect. Even those supposed titans of global finance -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- give little hint publicly that they grasp the threat or know what to do about it.This is no longer a minor \"Asian\" crisis. Japan's recession is its worst since World War II. Latin America's economies are slowing. \"Mexico's economy -- which had been growing 4 to 5 percent -- will be lucky to grow 2 percent next year,\" says economist Desmond Lachman of Salomon Smith Barney. Russia's depression hurts its Eastern European trading partners. China is slowing. Together, these areas represent almost half the world economy's output. The United States and Europe, with another 40 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), cannot easily escape the fallout.Given today's prosperity, Americans are naturally disbelieving. Unemployment is 4.5 percent. Inflation barely exists. Exports -- the sector directly affected by the global slump -- are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP. But economists (and others) often blunder by projecting the present into the future. America's prosperity is precarious precisely because things can't get better; they could easily get worse.How? The economic expansion began in 1991. Americans have already bought lots of cars, computers and clothes. Consumer debt (including home loans) is high. In the first half of 1998, the personal savings rate was less than one percent. Until recently, the jubilant stock market made Americans feel wealthier. They are spending some of their stock profits; since 1992, annual realized \"capital gains\" have roughly tripled. Now, lower stock prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending, which is two-thirds of GDP. Exports are already weakening; rising imports further imperil domestic production. Why, then, would companies continue to increase investment (11 percent of GDP)? A recession is clearly possible.And a U.S. slump would compound everyone else's problems. The United States is the world's largest importer, and other countries -- from South Korea to Brazil -- need to export to recover. Lower interest rates would improve the outlook. Economist Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Relations rightly says that the Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank should cut rates by half a percentage point. Lower rates would ease debt burdens and help sustain consumer spending and home-buying.\n",

In late April, a few hundred of Morgan Stanley's top stockbrokers and their spouses jetted off to Hawaii for a gathering spiced with golf, deep-sea fishing and suntanning.When they arrived at the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua, on Maui, the first perks of their all-expenses-paid trip were waiting for them: \"pillow gifts\" of GoPro cameras and Maui Jim sunglasses, said one attendee.With the stock market at record levels and wealth-management fees rising, Wall Street is reviving posh \"recognition\" junkets that were abruptly suspended in the 2008-2009 financial meltdown, when banks taking government bailouts wanted to avoid the appearance of extravagance. Morgan Stanley's Hawaii gathering was its most lavish since the crisis and its first outside of the continental U.S., according to advisers.Industry executives and analysts say the return of the junket reflects the bullish market and growing competition for top revenue-producing brokers, who, in addition to high pay, expect significant rewards for their efforts. Still, trips aren't as costly as those in precrisis days, and many now include work-related education and training.\"Prerecession, those trips were nothing but fun, but those are never coming back,\" said Steven Dudash, a financial adviser and president of IHT Wealth Management in Chicago, who has been in the industry for 15 years and recently left a job at Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch. \"I understand why in the public eye it would be frowned upon.\"\n",

NEW YORK -- Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. on Monday will introduce new indexes from the creator of the VIX \"fear gauge\" that will track popular stocks' performance against the broader market.The stock exchange tapped a duo that includes Robert Whaley, who developed the CBOE Market Volatility Index, to design the new \"Alpha Indexes.\" With regulators' approval, Nasdaq will offer derivatives to bet on or guard against moves in the new measures -- something Mr. Whaley envisions letting investors screen out even a stock-market crash from the returns of popular holdings like Apple Inc. or Citigroup Inc.\"The idea is to isolate what I'm focused on and get rid of the market bet,\" said Mr. Whaley, who is a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. The indexes, which Mr. Whaley co-developed with university colleague Jacob Sagi, are to be presented this week at the Futures Industry Association's Futures & Options Expo in Chicago. Nasdaq hopes to launch the derivatives built around the indexes early next year.With the severe stock-market gyrations of the financial crisis and this year's \"flash crash,\" interest in vehicles to track volatility and \"trade\" it with complex derivatives have soared. Stock-market correlation also has shot up, pushing investments often used to hedge or diversify into lock-step with major markets.The new Nasdaq products are built for investors seeking to combat those problems by isolating the pure \"alpha\" of a stock, said Eric Noll, Nasdaq OMX Group's executive vice president of transaction services. Alpha is a stock's outperformance relative to a benchmark.\n",

      " The Brokerage Business: Changing Roles --- Going From Stock Picker to Planner, Broker Adjusts to New Business Style. EDINA, Minn. -- Early in the morning of April 6, Wall Street got a wake-up call it won't soon forget.The news that Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. had agreed to merge in a $70 billion deal knocked many stockbrokers off their feet. When they recovered, many headed for the phones, calling their clients with short-term trading strategies to capitalize on the news.But not Noah Eisenberg. Mr. Eisenberg, a 16-year veteran broker with Dain Rauscher Corp. here, didn't even get to his suburban office until a half-hour before the stock market opened. Fresh from his usual 6 a.m. workout at a local health club, he found just five messages on his voice mail. None were from frantic customers who had heard about the Citicorp-Travelers merger. In fact, he didn't execute a single trade all day.\"A few years ago I would have been much more attuned to this,\" the 47-year-old broker says, pointing to a nearby television set blaring news of the deal. \"I would have had dozens of ideas of stocks I could sell. Now, it's just not that relevant to my business.\"That is because Mr. Eisenberg's business has undergone a fundamental shift during the past year and a half. Instead of playing the role of a traditional stockbroker -- picking individual stocks and charging his customers commissions each time they make a transaction -- he serves as more of an asset-gathering middleman.\n",

      " Ahead of the Tape. Government Spending Holds Key to GrowthAs goes government spending, so goes the U.S. economy.This is the unpleasant reality a weak recovery and already stretched Federal Reserve have bequeathed. Absent a sudden pick-up in private-sector activity, economic growth in the months ahead will largely take its cue from Congress and the White House. No wonder markets are jittery.For one, the hit from spending cuts across all levels of government has already been a major drag on growth. Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or \"outlays,\" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Their estimates show spending is down nearly 12% on average since May from a year earlier.\n",

The report is expected to show that non-farm employment grew a strong 292,000, while the civilian unemployment rate held steady at 5.3% last month, according to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.If employment growth is as robust as economists expect, it would put pressure on the Federal Open Market Committee to tighten monetary policy when the Fed policy-making body meets Tuesday and Wednesday, analysts said.The report is likely to lead to a \"volatile and erratic day,\" of trading, said Robert Falconer, a senior vice president in bond trading at CRT Government Securites Ltd. here. \"There is a strong likelihood that we will see a lot of selling.\"The data might also be used as a guiding light for finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations -- the U.S., Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Canada and Italy.

      " Politics & Economics: Center-Left Appears to Unseat Italy's Berlusconi; If Thin Victory Stands, Winner Prodi Would Face Tough Opposition Coalition. Rome -- IN AN ELECTION that came down to a handful of votes, Italy's center-left coalition leader Romano Prodi appeared to eke out a narrow victory -- but by such a razor-thin margin that it is unlikely his longtime adversary, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will be consigned to the sidelines.Mr. Berlusconi, speaking on national television yesterday evening, refused to concede defeat and suggested that it might be necessary to form a coalition government with his political foes. He also spoke of \"numerous irregularities\" in the voting, without being more specific.About half a million ballots were declared invalid, and if they are re-examined, as members of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition have demanded, it is possible the outcome of the vote could flip. A recount could prompt a period of political uncertainty and lead to a contested final outcome -- a situation analogous to the protracted stalemate between George W. Bush and Al Gore following the U.S. presidential election in 2000.In addition, the vote leaves room for the 69-year-old Mr. Berlusconi, who has made a career of defying the odds, to wield tremendous influence on the political stage. Even if Mr. Prodi's lead is confirmed, his thin margin will make it difficult to push through any of the economic restructuring measures many economists believe the country badly needs.\"Before this election we were hoping that we'd be able to assess the strategy of the new government, whoever they were, for dealing with [Italy's] public finance problems,\" said Brian Coulton, a Fitch ratings analyst. \"Now there's the risk that it will be impossible to have any kind of strategy.\"\n",

The corrective machinery is already at work: The dollarUas exchange rate is falling. But itUas a cumbersome process, and the effects probably wonUat be visible until the end of this year.Economists call it the J-curve, meaning that the deficit gets worse and the line dips down before it turns around and starts upward toward balance. The reason is that the financial markets that set the exchange rates move much faster than the real economy of boxes and bales of goods delivered on the wharf. In general it takes something over a year for the deliveries to be made, the contracts to come up for renegotiation and the importers to find domestic suppliers to replace their increasingly expensive foreign sources.1984.\tThe rate then rose higher to a peak just a year ago and did not drop significantly lower until last summer.

Or hung out by street vendors in three-for-$10 clusters so thick you could use them as automatic carwash brushes. Even at Brothers, where next to the tiny pheasants there's an apocalyptic paisley.Just a few years ago, these neckties were not only out of fashion, not only bad taste, they were reactionary relics of the 1940s, like Filipinos standing in dime-store windows demonstrating yo-yos.

There was something irreducible about them, the distillation of male respectability to a Zenlike potency.It started with the trend-surfers, the retro freaks, the thrift- shop mavens. They were the first to spot the styles of the '40s and '50s as a growth stock.

The Court ruled -- unanimously -- that the law was, in a word, too \"vague.\"Here is the classic description of the void-for-vagueness doctrine from Justice George Sutherland in 1926: \"a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning . . . violates the first essential of due process of law.\"That any such common-sense rule still exists in law, politics or life is a wonder.Strictly, the vagueness test applies only to penal law, but in a better world would it not also apply to much else in public life?

UAL said it generated $500 million in cash since March 31, boosting its unrestricted cash balance to $4.2 billion, despite higher fuel expenses.On the expense site, United said it intends to lop $300 million from its costs this year and hopes to achieve a portion of its 2007 cost- reduction target of $400 million in 2006. Part of the savings will come from cutting at least 1,000 salaried and management jobs this year. UAL said its unit cost, or the cost to fly a mainline seat a mile, increased 9%.

      " Credit Ratings: Credit Ratings Of 3 Bank Firms Are Cut by S&P. Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on the senior debt of Bank of New England Corp., Bank of Boston Corp. and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group because of the worsening New England economy, particularly its real estate sector.S&P said it lowered its ratings on $820 million of Bank of Boston's debt. Among the issues affected were the Boston-based company's senior debt, whose rating was lowered to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus; subordinated debt, downgraded to double-B-plus from triple-B; preferred stock, lowered to double-B from triple-B-minus; and commercial paper, reduced to A-3 from A-2.The Bank of Boston issues were removed from CreditWatch, where they were placed April 30 with negative implications, S&P added.S&P said Bank of Boston's first-quarter results \"evidence the company's slide in asset quality and continued deepening of the New England regional real estate recession.\" S&P added that the company's loan-loss provisions haven't \"kept pace with problem loan identification, and it is likely that lower profitability in future quarters will result.\"Peter J. Manning, Bank of Boston's chief financial officer, said that the company is \"obviously disappointed\" at the rating change, and that \"we stand ready to deal with uncertainties in the current economic environment.\"\n",

      " Sales Growth In Electronics Short-Circuits. CONSUMER SPENDING on electronics had ridden out the falling economy fairly well as shoppers trekked to electronics stores for big-screen TVs, DVD players, digital cameras and other gadgets. But then this summer store traffic stopped as if someone had pulled the plug.Yet the retailers don't blame the stock market for the problem. Their culprit: car makers.No-interest financing and other payment plans are enticing consumers to spend their money on cars instead of electronics or other gadgets. The retailers, such as Best Buy Co. and RadioShack Corp., hope the sales slump is merely temporary, but are bracing for something worse.Wendy Smith, a 34-year-old homemaker in Crofton, Md., roughly doubled her monthly car payments to $430 when she bought a Saturn wagon in late June, upgrading from a three-door coupe. But she and her husband decided to wait until next year to replace their six-year-old home computer.\"The zero-percent financing is what got us there,\" Ms. Smith said. \"We're just cutting back on other purchases.\"\n",

Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s investment arm are expected to purchase Education Management Corp. for $3.4 billion, people familiar with the matter said, as increased access to federal funding improves the prospects of for-profit trade schools and universities.Education Management runs 72 primary campuses across the U.S. and Canada, training its 72,000 enrolled students in fields such as fashion, psychology and Web-site design. It also runs a small but growing operation providing online instruction.For-profit education has become a growth business in the U.S., as tuition costs at traditional nonprofit colleges and universities soar. New students also are choosing to take their courses online, a more convenient and more profitable method.Providence and Goldman Sachs are expected to pay about $43 for each share of Education Management, a 16% premium to the Pittsburgh company's stock price in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading Friday. The company's board has approved the transaction, and it is expected to be announced this morning. Shareholders must approve the final offer.The for-profit space was given a boost in recent days, when Congress lifted the requirement that colleges must deliver half their courses at a physical campus to qualify for financial student aid. That means the for-profit providers, of which Education Management is ranked No. 3 by revenue, can attract a new set of potential students to their programs.\n",

      " A Bad Excuse for Bias. The attacks by Nation of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad on Jews and by local radio personality Cathy Hughes on Hispanics occurred at different times and in different places and, on the surface, are completely unrelated.But defenders of both tirades have used similar twisted logic in justifying the attacks. Boiled down, their reasoning goes like this: Attacking an entire group of people is justified not necessarily because the targets are worthy of being excoriated but because the verbal assaults are a vehicle for inspiring blacks to help themselves.At Kean College in New Jersey late last year, Muhammad called Jews \"the bloodsuckers of the black nation,\" and said they control the Federal Reserve and the White House. He said Jews are known by such names as Rubenstein, Silverstein and Goldstein because they hoard rubies, silver and gold. Muhammad was later stripped of his position with the Nation of Islam by Minister Louis Farrakhan, who nonetheless said he basically agreed with what Muhammad said.On Jan. 26, Hughes, speaking to listeners of her WOL-AM radio station, said Hispanics have \"taken over\" parts of Washington along 14th Street NW. She complained about Hispanic drunk drivers and overcrowded Hispanic apartments, which she said have driven some African Americans out of her neighborhood. While Hispanics without green cards stream into the country to get jobs, open businesses, and soak the welfare system, the mayor and the city council seem to \"look the other way,\" Hughes said.In a Feb. 6 column, my friend and colleague Courtland Milloy offered a curious defense of Muhammad and Farrakhan, who has a history of demonizing Jewish people: \"I believe Farrakhan sets out to incite Jews not so much because he hates them but because Jewish reactions to attack are instructive. A minority with a history of oppression, Jews command respect,\" Milloy wrote. \"You don't see them begging or apologizing for defending themselves.\"\n",

Now that the pipes have opened up, a new era has dawned, and companies seizing that change would be great investments for his soon-to-be launched mutual fund, even at today's sky-high prices.Morty Schaja, president of Baron Capital Group, disagrees with his fund manager. \"I'm uncomfortable with the business,\" he says. \"But if the valuation was 10 or 20 times less than it is now, I might be interested.\"Too risky, too expensive.

      " The Outlook: Recession-Free 1988? Don't Bet the Ranch. NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise.\n",

Cyclicals are back!Beaten down in the second half of 1994 by rising interest rates and fears of a sharp slowdown this year, economically sensitive stocks have rallied twice in the first two months of 1995. The latest recovery, which started this month, is a clear bet by some investors that the Federal Reserve will be able to engineer a soft landing, slow economic growth coupled with continued low inflation.\"Investors are concluding that sometime in '95, the Fed will be done tightening and that there will be a resurgence in the economy late this year or perhaps in '96,\" says Thomas McManus, market strategist at Morgan Stanley. \"Some of these [cyclicals] are the stocks that did the worst in '94.\"Weathervanes of the economy, cyclicals rally on economic recoveries but trail in recessions.

The index had a steady decline in the second half of 1994, culminating in a 52-week low of 273 on Nov. 23. It then made a first run at a comeback, climbing to 305 on Jan. 15, before skidding sharply. The Federal Reserve's move to boost short-term interest rates by an additional half percentage point on Feb. 1 was widely perceived as the last tightening for the foreseeable future and just the touch needed to bring the economy gliding down gently to more sustainable growth levels.\n",

      " President's New Life Has an International Focus. WASHINGTON -- President Bush was up around 5:30 a.m. as usual on Tuesday, the two-week anniversary of the terrorist attacks. He walked his dogs Barney and Spot, thumbed through the morning papers and -- unwilling to wait an hour for breakfast with congressional leaders -- ate a bowl of cereal.Even in the tumult of these times, it is a point of pride for this control-conscious president to maintain an ordinary schedule: early to bed, early to rise. But as the rest of his day shows, the president and his presidency have been forever changed.The president often appears more serious, more stern and more conscious of the image he projects, here and abroad, according to lawmakers and aides who have spent time with him. A unilateralist for much of his first eight months in office, he has found himself relying on numerous foreign leaders, phoning them from the Oval Office in the morning, and from his residence after sundown.Remarkably, for a man who came to office unschooled in foreign affairs and with scant experience abroad, Mr. Bush has embraced the foreign-policy imperative and, aides say, shows far less interest in the domestic matters that had preoccupied him up to now. He has winnowed his agenda to \"bipartisan-only\" legislation. In the conduct of domestic and international affairs, he has formed the kind of alliance with Democrats in Congress that he talked about in his 2000 campaign, but hadn't forged in office.\"The terrorist attacks impacted him personally [and] impacted his agenda,\" says Dan Bartlett, a top aide. \"His days have changed.\"\n",

      " Unemployment rate fell slightly in Dec.. The nation's jobless rate dropped slightly to 6.4 percent in December, and the number of jobs nationwide increased modestly--news that the financial markets and economists viewed as reassuring signs that economic growth would be steady but not strong enough to revive inflation.The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since early 1991, down from 6.5 percent in November, the government reported yesterday. The November number, however, was revised upward from 6.4 percent initially reported a month ago. The adjustment was made to reflect seasonal variations.The reports from the Labor Department were read as good news, partly because the prospect of moderate growth helped ease fears that the Federal Reserve Board would increase short-term interest rates to control inflation.\"The economy is on track for steady economic growth in 1994,\" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. She noted that pressures that could lead to inflation appeared to be \"tame.\"Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist with Merrill Lynch & Co., said the Labor Department's unemployment release \"is another good report in indicating that there really aren't significant inflationary pressures in the economy.\"\n",

      " The Outlook: Capital Spending Will Boost Recovery. NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity.\n",

      " Political Debate Over Jobs Intensifies; Bush Team Hopes for Lift From Friday Payroll Data; Revisions to Get Attention. The jobs debate heats up this week, with the White House expecting that revised payroll data to be released Friday will put a shine on President Bush's record of helping the economy create new jobs.Friday's data will be the last released before the Nov. 2 election. While markets will focus on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report for September, politicians might pay more attention to revised data for the period from March 2003 through March 2004.A memo from the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the payroll-employment figure for that period could be revised upward by 288,000 jobs, and conceivably by as much as 384,000. In August, nonfarm payroll employment stood 913,000 jobs, or 0.8%, below the level when President Bush took office.Even a lesser revision, combined with additional jobs reported for July through September, would reduce Mr. Bush's first-term jobs deficit and weaken challenger Sen. John Kerry's attacks on his economic policies. The two meet for a town-hall style debate Friday evening in St. Louis, and are scheduled to debate domestic policy the following Wednesday.The White House estimate, prepared by career CEA technical staff, hasn't any effect on what the independent BLS actually will report Friday. \"This is a very preliminary estimate,\" said CEA spokesman Phillip Swagel, adding it was generated by an economic model with a typical statistical error range of plus or minus 140,000 jobs. \"The only number that matters is the number that the BLS announces on Friday.\" The BLS will incorporate its revisions in the official data in February.\n",

It was Good Friday, the stock market was closed, and the man who manages a $2 billion portfolio of securities from his Chevy Chase office was happy. Free from phone calls and other interruptions related to the financial markets, Louis A. Simpson sat in his Geico Corp. office and read 15 annual reports.Simpson's good days have turned into good years since he joined Geico as the insurance company's chief stock market strategist in 1979. For the past seven years, Simpson's ability to pick stocks for Geico has placed him in the top tier of money managers nationwide.Simpson says there is no mystery to his stock market magic. A voracious reader, the 50-year-old vice chairman of Geico searches daily newspapers, magazines, annual reports and newsletters for clues that might spark investment ideas. His four-member investment team uses computer screens to identify stocks that, on the basis of financial data, appear to be bargains.But there is more to Simpson's research than crunching, or analyzing, numbers and combing periodicals. After identifying a stock for a possible purchase, Simpson or a member of his staff will attempt to arrange a meeting with that company's senior management. Because of the large blocks of stock that Simpson can buy for Geico, management often complies with such requests.Simpson's reputation as a long-term investor, rather than a short-term trader, also helps him gain access to management. If management refuses to meet, Simpson typically will not buy the stock. Once he makes a commitment, Simpson expects meetings with the company's management to continue as long as Geico owns its stake.\n",

Per-share figures for Ford and Chrysler have been adjusted to reflect 3-for-2 stock splits on June 1 at Ford and March 5 at Chrysler.Ford attributed its earnings increase from a year earlier to higher wholesale unit sales, a more profitable product mix, improved productivity and a net gain of $102 million, or 38 cents a share, from the previously reported sales of its North American paint operation and its 70% stake in Starnet Corp. Chrysler said costs of developing and launching new products helped push its third-quarter earnings below the year-earlier level.Ford shares spurted $3.875, to $59.125, in active trading, and Chrysler climbed $1.125, to $37.75, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\n",

NEW YORK -- Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange accounted for 11.3% of overall volume in 1995, or an average of 39.7 million daily shares.It was the most active year, in terms of volume, for the computer-aided trading activity that critics blame for causing artificially sharp moves in the market. But because overall volume also soared on the exchange, the percentage figure of 11.3% wasn't a record; indeed, it represented a decline from last year's 11.6%. (The record was 11.9% in 1993.)The Big Board has released program-trading data since mid-1988, in response to an outcry over the multistock trading activity and its role in the 1987 stock-market crash. Program trading is defined as the buying or selling of a group of at least 15 different stocks valued at a total of $1 million or more.The five most active program-trading firms in 1995 through the end of September, the latest numbers available, were Morgan Stanley Group Inc.; First Options; the U.S. unit of Japan's Nomura Securities; CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holding; and Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit.The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and options.

After a lifetime spent as a public servant, the former Senate majority leader has managed to squirrel away a million-dollar nest egg that would be the envy of most retirees.Indeed, last year he and his wife, Elizabeth, reported total income of $583,869, putting them in the top 1 percent of Americans.A review of Dole's personal finances shows that this man of humble origins, who inherited nothing, spent his entire life in government and never invested in the stock market, has built a comfortable net worth in a quintessentially Washington way: through a steady flow of speaking fees paid to him by special interest groups. Indeed, during his three decades in Congress, Dole took in some $1.7 million in honoraria, more than any other member of either the House or the Senate.All of what Dole did over the years was legal, and because of restrictions on how much honoraria members could keep, he passed on more than half of what he made to charity. But at a time when the influence of money on politics is drawing increased public scrutiny, Dole's financial transformation makes clear why those in position to reform the process have been so reluctant to change it.\n",

Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had projected a profit of $1.61 a share.Net revenue, or revenue minus interest expense, was $4.41 billion, up 35% from $3.28 billion a year earlier and down 1.1% from $4.46 billion in the first quarter.In recent weeks, there has been concern that falling stock markets and rising interest rates may make it tougher for firms like Lehman to continue posting record results. Lehman's earnings, while strong, may give investors a road map for some of the trouble spots to come.In a report to investors, Prudential Equity Group LLC analyst Michael Mayo said some of the firm's results were \"mixed.\" Revenue from equity trading fell 7% quarter to quarter, in part, he said, because of the rocky stock market. The firm's investment-banking results, while up 28% from a year earlier, fell 11% from the previous quarter.

      " Falling Energy Prices May Bring Needed Boost to Ailing Economy --- Savings for Individuals, Firms May Free Tens of Billions For Additional Spending. NEW YORK -- The ailing U.S. economy could soon get a much-needed boost from an unexpected source: falling energy prices.Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some economists expected oil prices to rise on fears that a war in the Middle East would disrupt the supply of oil. Instead, prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have all fallen as concerns have grown that a possible global recession could drastically cut demand for energy.In the short run, those declines should act like a tax cut for consumers, freeing up funds for additional spending. They should also help cut costs at companies that have big fuel bills, including those in some of the hardest-hit industries, including airlines, trucking companies and manufacturers.In total, the recent declines could produce \"tens of billions of dollars in savings\" for companies and individual users of fuel, says Tom Robinson, senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.While that alone won't keep the country out of recession, it certainly will \"act as a salve in the wounds from the recession we're in,\" adds Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley.\n",

Talk of coordinated action by the world's top central banks to weaken the yen has weighed on the Japanese currency since it flirted with 100 yen to $1 late December.But most analysts believe the Tokyo G-7 summit will offer little beyond the kind of joint communique issued at the September 1999 G-7 meeting in Washington, in which finance ministers groused about the strong yen and its potential effects on the Japanese and world economies, but ruled out joint intervention to weaken it.\"There's a lot of rhetoric about concerted G-7 intervention, particularly in Japan,\" said Jeff Cheah, market strategist at Standard & Poor's MMS online service in Toronto. \"But we haven't seen the G-7 intervene for a long time, and I don't think dollar/yen has got to a level where it's considered excessive enough to warrant intervention.\"\n",

      " FedEx Sees a Bumpy Road for Economy; Shipper Cuts Forecast For Year, Doesnt' Expect Big Lift From Holidays. FedEx Corp. threw some cold water on hopes that holiday shoppers would give the uncertain economic outlook a boost.The Memphis, Tenn., shipping giant -- regarded as an economic gauge because it handles an average of more than six million packages a day across the world -- reduced its profit target for the year because of an economic outlook pinched by the weak U.S. housing market and higher energy prices. The company said that as a result, it would ratchet back on capital spending.\"We believe U.S. [gross domestic product] will grow less than 3%\" for the rest of FedEx's fiscal year, which ends May 30, said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan B. Graf Jr. He said the company lowered its profit guidance \"almost entirely based on freight market\" and economic forecasts.The reduced outlook overshadowed FedEx's results for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, which rose 4% from a year earlier. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of FedEx fell $2.88 to $104.63.Wall Street had hoped for a lift for sluggish freight-industry volumes from the annual holiday shipping surge. The peak shipping season traditionally begins in late summer and builds into the fall as retailers and other businesses load boats, planes, trains and trucks with products ahead of the holiday shopping crush.\n",

Robert Galvin, Motorola Inc.'s legendary former chairman, plans to resign this spring from the board, marking an end to his more than 60-year reign at the technology and equipment giant.Mr. Galvin's departure comes at a time when his son, Motorola Chief Executive Christopher Galvin, is under tremendous pressure to prove his management mettle in what is turning into one of the most challenging chapters in Motorola's 73-year history. The elder Mr. Galvin has been a staunch supporter of his son's efforts to turn the company around.The Schaumburg, Ill., firm Friday warned that a severe slump in orders and sales could result in the company's first quarterly loss in 16 years. It was the second earnings warning issued during the past six weeks.Motorola blamed the decrease in orders on the slowing economy, but it also is clear that the company has made a number of missteps that have contributed to its problems.Alarmed investors drove down shares of Motorola more than 6%, or $1.04, to $16.25 as of 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\n",

      " Quarterly Monitor; A Periodic Look at Performance And Where Investor Money is Moving. Giving Back GainsIn the latest quarter, U.S.-stock funds gave back part, but not all, of the gains they rang up in the first three months of 2012.The average diversified U.S.-stock fund posted a negative 4.6% return for the three months through June, as investors fretted about the strength of the U.S. recovery and about the debt crisis in Europe. That left the funds up an average of 7% so far this year, after a 12.3% advance in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters Corp.'s Lipper unit.Dividend-focused equity-income funds had some of the smallest losses, returning an average of negative 2.2%. Many investors have turned to income-oriented stock funds as a relatively conservative stock-market play and, in some cases, as an alternative to bond funds in an era of ultralow interest rates.Diversified international-stock funds fell harder than U.S.-focused funds, returning a negative 7.1% in the second quarter, according to Lipper. That leaves them with an average gain of 3.8% for the first six months of 2012. Emerging-markets funds fell 8.5%, leaving them up 4.3% for the year to date.\n",

An hour earlier so many of the initial gains had been cut or erased that it looked as if the market might end with a slight loss if the erosion continued.The market was higher in early trading but backtracked most of the afternoon as turnover faded. Prices steadied, however, and as action became dull new buying came in.

This refers to the total number of borrowed shares sold in the hope that they can be replaced by stock bought at a low er price.Autos were early leaders in the advance. General Motors was spurred by talk of better earnings and the possibility of a year-end extra dividend.

      " Letters to the Editor: Chile and Japan: Solid Partnership. Your article on Chile-Japan trade, \"Chilean Firms Suffer Pain From Japanese Recession,\" is engaging and encouraging, yet its focus on short-term setbacks may stand a different reading if viewed from a global, longer-term perspective. To Chile, trading with Japan is part of a broader Asia positioning effort whose scope reaches beyond short-term issues. The two nations have a century-old record of cooperation and trade. Distance has been no object to doing business. Japan, now the second most important destination for global Chilean exports, has ranked as one of our four largest trading partners ever since 1970. About 13% of all Chilean goods currently sold abroad are bought by Japan.The success of Chile-Japan trade links warrants further analysis. Our partnership is far from having peaked, and Japan is far from a market lacking in possibilities. True, the dollar value of sales to Japan fell 28% in 1998, but a whopping 82% of this (U.S. $593 million) was simply due to lower ore and copper prices. A softer market for just five items -- mineral ores, copper cathodes, dressed pine boards, gold, and fish in brine -- accounted for 100% of the dollar drop in sales to Japan. Such is the predicament of commodity sellers today, a predicament that is hard on us all, not just Japan.Still, the record for 1998 shows an 81% increase in the diversity of products exported to Japan over 1997, as well as 27 firms newly joining the ranks of bilateral trade. In other words, despite Japan's downturn, trade with Chile, save for a few, admittedly major items, continues to thrive.Hector CasanuevaDirector, ProChile\n",

      " The Washington Post Thursday, October 1, 198? A21  . or which rights. What baffles these senators is BorkUas recognition of the problem that a judge has to choose among rights and his effort to find some principled basis for the choice. In all of their sentimental demagoguery about rights his opponents have never explained whose rights they want to subordinate. I have heard nothing from Bork to deny that the definition and allocation of rights properly change over time, by legislative action or judicial decisions, in response to changing conditions, including community values. But what I do hear from him is a reluctance to make a leap in the dark, declaring rights in particular cases without weighing the indirect and future consequences of such declarations.This brings up the question of precedents. There has been much discussion of whether Judge Bork properly respects the precedents created by previous court decisions. No attention has been paid to the question of a justiceUas respect for his successors, who may be bound by the precedents he sets. What I understand Bork to say is that a justice should not set precedents for his successors without carefully considering the full range of their implications.The Gnsuxdd case, in which we have all had' an education in the last two weeks, is an example. Here was a stupid Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives. The question is whether the best way to get rid of that stupid class. His iconodasm, while stimulating in a professor, can be disastrous in a judge. What is important is not how nimble his argument will be, but how his' decisions will affect millions of Americans who will have to live by them.So ultimately what weUare asking is not only whatUas in Judge BorkUas mind but also whatUas in his heart Is he sensitive to human and racial problems?I can hear his supporters saying that here comes the irrational argument. But it is prudence, not irrationality, to give as much emphasis to citizen BorkUas past views as to nominee BorkUas new views. His supporters say, \"CanUat one change his views?U Yes, certainly. Otherwise, how could we, in the last 32 years, have1 moved from a time when the air was heavy with racism to one in which the union of religious faith and civic action has begun to create a new American reality. So, yes, people can change.\n",

      " Home Price Forecast 2002: Bouncing Back? --- Despite Economy, Home Prices Again Start Gaining Ground; But `Fire Sales' In Denver. CAN PRICES GO any lower in San Francisco? Will war benefit home sellers in Los Angeles? And how much more expensive will homes nationally be this year than last?The answers: Yes, maybe and just a bit, according to the most recent Home Price Forecast done by Case Shiller Weiss, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, for The Wall Street Journal. But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up. Home prices nationally will once again climb over the coming year, by an average of 2.8%. In fact, out of the 20 cities tracked, only two won't see prices rise, the forecasters say.Still, the upswing will be remarkably varied across the country, with some cities, such as San Diego, barely squeaking ahead (prices are expected to go up by just 0.8% there), while others, like Washington, D.C., should boast a robust jump of more than 7%. And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year. \"We're not out of the woods yet,\" says the firm's Karl Case, who takes into account past sale prices, the number of homes on the market and the number of people setting up new households when making his predictions.Patrick and Sharon Brem discovered that for themselves when they recently tried to sell their loft in downtown San Francisco. That market has been one of the hardest hit in recent months and the economists say prices will drop by an additional 5.7% this year, making it the only city in the survey where they'll actually fall. The Brems were asking $969,000 for their place, but settled for $730,000 -- or exactly what they paid for it two years ago. \"We consider ourselves lucky to get out when we did,\" says Mrs. Brem, an Internet developer. A lot of people haven't been able to find buyers: The number of sales there fell by 27% in November from the year before.Home prices were flagging even before Sept. 11 -- in the first quarter of 2001, the National Association of Realtors found that prices had started downward in more than a quarter of the 128 major metro areas it tracks. And they were down in the immediate aftermath of the attacks -- September median new home prices dropped 5.1%, while those of existing homes fell 3.6%. But overall, the housing market has held its ground remarkably well despite the shaky economy, propped up by numerous interest-rate cuts and consumer faith in the housing market. During the third quarter of last year, inflation-adjusted prices nationally rose 6.1% from a year earlier, according to the federal government.\n",

      " Safety In Numbers. I knew I was perhaps too concentrated in Washington Post stock (about 17 percent) and maybe a little light when it came to bonds (4 percent), but I figured I was pretty well off when it came to the rest of my stock investments. After all, I had investments in four stock mutual funds.That was before I looked closer. Two stock mutual funds accounted for most of my holdings, and it turned out they had a lot in common. Two of their top five holdings were identical: Citigroup and Bank of America made up more than 4 percent of the holdings of one mutual fund and more than 8 percent of the holdings of another.And it turns out I'm not alone. Most of us are not as diversified as we should be when it comes to retirement investments. At its simplest, diversification means investing in different types of assets.When it comes to retirement savings, the choices are basically stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money-market funds. Put all your money in a single stock, and you may be exposed to more risk than you realize -- as employees at Enron and WorldCom learned, to their sorrow. At the other extreme, invest completely in safer but lower-yielding investments, and you may be earning less than with a more diversified portfolio.But you also need to spread your risks within each asset category. That's why so many investors choose mutual funds, which allow them to own a small portion of a large number of investments. But buying more than one mutual fund may not add much to the diversity of your investments if the funds are investing in the same companies. And sometimes they are, as I found.\n",

      " Fed Rate Cut Puts Pressure on Europe to Follow --- Inflation Deters the ECB, And Nations' Needs Differ; Postponing the Inevitable?. FRANKFURT -- The Federal Reserve's hefty interest-rate cut adds to the mounting pressure on the European Central Bank to follow suit today to boost the flagging euro-zone economy, but stubbornly high inflation and national politics are putting the world's No. 2 central bank in a bind.Inflation isn't falling significantly despite the slowdown, and remains above the ECB's target of 2%. In addition, inflation rates among the 12 nations in the euro zone are diverging. This makes a one-size-fits-all monetary policy more difficult to practice and pits the interests of small, higher-inflation countries against those of the large nations that would likely benefit from lower rates.At today's meeting, the ECB will weigh whether the bad news on the economy warrants a shift in focus from fighting inflation to supporting growth, a move that could by extension aid the U.S. and global economy. Over the past month, further evidence of a halting recovery has continued to pour in. Just yesterday, Germany reported that orders to its manufacturing industry fell a monthly 2.5% in September, dimming the prospects of Europe's largest economy. And in France, the region's second-largest powerhouse, industrial demand fell in the third quarter of this year, and a survey showed that business executives expect a further drop in the fourth. The Fed's decision also underscores the weakness of the U.S. economy, which Europe traditionally counts on to pull it out of a slump.Already this year, the ECB did an about-face on its attitude toward inflation. During the summer, the bank was gearing up to raise borrowing costs but had to quickly retract that plan as the recovery and stock markets faltered. Still, during the past few days, public statements from ECB officials suggested the 18-member governing council hadn't yet reached an agreement to cut rates as early as today. The ECB has surprised markets before, however.Some economists believe that if the ECB holds rates steady today, it will simply postpone the inevitable, miss a chance to appear proactive, and come under fire from the politicians, banks and media. \"What do they win or lose by waiting another four weeks?\" said Julian von Landesberger, an economist with HVB Group in Munich. \"Until now the ECB was much too optimistic with regard to growth next year.\"\n",

At General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, more flexible union agreements now allow the companies to build cars for 120 hours a week or more while paying less in overtime pay.Nearly 40% of car factories in North America now operate on work schedules that push production well past 80 hours a week, compared with 11% in 2008, said Ron Harbour, a senior partner with the Oliver Wyman Inc. management consulting firm.\"There has never been a time in the U.S. industry that we've had this high a level of capacity utilization,\" he said.The Detroit auto makers closed 27 factories following the financial crisis as GM and Chrysler went through government-led bankruptcies.

      " Veterans' Group Wants Larger Raise for Military. Concerned that Congress is moving toward providing a 2.2 percent pay raise for the military next year, a leading veterans' group said that with troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is not the time to skimp on a raise.The House approved a fiscal 2007 defense appropriations bill late Tuesday that would raise military pay by 2.2 percent, effective in January. Senate negotiators have signed off on the raise, but the full Senate has not voted on the spending bill.More than just the military raise may be at stake because the military raise usually spills over into the civil service. Congress in most recent years has adopted a \"pay parity\" policy that calls for equal raises for the two workforces.The Military Officers Association of America, known as MOAA, yesterday urged Congress to approve a 2.7 percent across-the-board raise for the armed forces. \"As a nation, we ought to do better for our military than we are about to do,\" said Norb Ryan Jr., president of MOAA and a retired vice admiral.MOAA and other military groups made some progress toward a 2.7 percent military raise earlier this year when the House approved it as part of a fiscal 2007 authorization bill for defense programs. The Senate version, however, stuck with the White House's recommendation for a 2.2 percent raise.\n",

      " Four Md. Universities To Furlough in Spring. At least four of Maryland's public universities will furlough their faculty and staff for as many as three days this spring in an attempt to balance their budgets after deep state funding cuts.The furloughs, authorized by the state Board of Regents yesterday, will be staggered across the workforce so that no classes will have to be canceled and other campus services will suffer only minimal disruption, officials said.University leaders said the furloughs -- the first since the early 1990s -- are the only way to prevent layoffs in light of a $67 million cut from the current academic year's appropriation. The university system earlier imposed a hiring freeze and the first midyear tuition increases in more than a decade.\"Every institution has taken a deep breath and decided this is what we have to do,\" said Calvin Lowe, president of Bowie State University, one of the furloughing schools. The others are the University of Maryland Baltimore County, the University of Maryland- Eastern Shore and Frostburg State University. A fifth campus, Salisbury University, will probably furlough employees next academic year, system officials said.Employee unions vowed yesterday to fight the furlough, while faculty complained they could have lasting effects on staff morale. \"The long-term effect of furloughs is to destroy collegiality and educational quality,\" said David L. Parker, a mathematics professor at Salisbury and president of the Council of University System Faculty.\n",

      " Moving the Market: House Passes Curb On Expense Rules For Stock Options. WASHINGTON -- The House, responding to lobbying by technology companies, overwhelmingly approved a bill that would limit the required \"expensing\" of stock options.The bill overrides a proposal by a national accounting-standards panel that would have required companies to expense the value of all stock options. In their 312-111 vote, the lawmakers instead approved legislation to limit the expensing rule to options granted only to the top five officers of a company. The Financial Accounting Standards Board had proposed earlier this year that companies subtract the value of all employee stock compensation from company profits.The House vote gives the tech lobby, led by Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp., a significant victory over a weighty list of policy makers who argued against Congress intruding in standard-setting in the wake of major accounting-fraud scandals beginning with Enron Corp.Among strong supporters of stock-option expensing as a means to improve the accuracy of financial statements are Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary John Snow, and Securities and Exchange Commission William Donaldson. Mr. Greenspan warned Congress earlier this year \"it would be a bad mistake for the Congress to impede FASB,\" because the proposed accounting for stock options \"strikes me as correct.\"Still, the measure faces stiff opposition in the Senate. Even though a comparable bill is pending in the Senate with 25 co-sponsors, Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who chairs the banking committee, has pledged to block any effort by Congress to meddle in rule-making by FASB, an independent accounting-standards body based in Norwalk, Conn.\n",

      " Fed Report Sets Stage for Dispute Over Growth; Central Bank Targets Slower Recovery, Lower Inflation Than Administration. The Federal Reserve has set the stage for a continuing election year argument with the Bush administration over interest rates by aiming for slower economic growth and lower inflation in 1992 than the administration is seeking.Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that he expects a \"robust\" recovery now that the recession has ended. But after an initial rebound by the end of this year that will make up the economic ground lost during the slump, Greenspan said the central bank's top policy makers expect to provide enough money and credit to fuel an economy growing in the 2.25 percent to 3 percent range in 1992.Bush administration economists, on the other hand, this week reiterated a forecast that calls for a similar rebound this year but with growth continuing next year at a 3.6 percent rate.If the pace does begin to lag below administration plans, senior officials such as Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and perhaps President Bush himself could renew their frequent public statements urging the Fed to cut interest rates to boost growth. Key short-term interest rates are now about 5.75 percent, down about 2 percentage points since last fall.In the Fed's midyear report to Congress, Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee: \"Monetary policy during the first half of the year has had two jobs, first, to help bring the economy out of recession, and second, to avoid setting the stage for the next recession, which would follow if we allowed\" inflation to get out of hand. \"The progress against inflation must not be lost.\"\n",

Firestone's top executive said the company realized there were problems with the treads on its Wilderness AT tires under \"severe\" conditions and moved to improve that model before it announced the recall of 6.5 million of its ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires.Masatoshi Ono, chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., said in an interview that Firestone had \"implemented measures to improve the performance of the Wilderness tires\" before the recall.Mr. Ono said the tire maker began to make those improvements when it realized the treads could separate under \"severe\" conditions, such as high-speed driving in sweltering heat with underinflated tires. Mr. Ono also conceded that Firestone and Ford Motor Co. had disagreed over proper tire-inflation levels.Yesterday, Bridgestone/Firestone was forced to make a major concession aimed at accelerating the process of replacing the millions of recalled tires.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation about breast-feeding duration has not changed so dramatically as was suggested by \"What's Good for the Baby May Guilt-Trip the Mother {Second Opinion, December 9}. Previously, they recommended \"breast-feed to one year\"; currently, they say \"breast-feed to at least one year.\" They present a solid body of evidence supporting the vital importance of breast-feeding to women's and children's health, and its potential impact on health care costs, the environment, maternal job satisfaction and productivity.The column missed the forest (the vast improvements in women's lives when this country becomes a truly breast-feeding society) for the trees (the temporary difficulties some women may face in the process).As a family physician who believes physicians have a responsibility to provide people with accurate and current data from which they can make informed health decisions, I believe that withholding vital information to spare people feelings of guilt or failure is patronizing at best, negligent at worst.Prospective parents need correct information about the crucial infant feeding decision. The AAP has provided it. Let's hope this gives parents the impetus to choose breast-feeding in a decidedly bottle-feeding culture.

You could do exposes about how hospitals and health care professionals often sabotage new mothers' efforts to breast-feed their babies.

      " Global Finance: IMF: Size Gives Large Banks Big Funding Edge. The International Monetary Fund is the latest organization to weigh in on what many lawmakers have been saying since the financial crisis: Size does matter when it comes to being a bank.Large U.S. banks received a funding advantage of as much as $70 billion between 2011 and 2012, as investors demanded lower interest rates because of a perception that the government wouldn't let such firms fail during turbulent times, an IMF study found.The benefit is global: Big banks in the euro area received as much as $300 billion in funding-cost advantages during that period, varying from $25 billion to $110 billion in Japan and $20 billion to $110 billion in the U.K., based on the analysis by the international organization based in Washington.The study suggests regulators have work to do to curb the perception that banks are \"too big to fail.\" The IMF found the expected value of government guarantees for a distressed bank is roughly comparable to what they enjoyed before the 2008 financial crisis.\"The high degree of concentration carries with it a high degree of potential systemic risk,\" according to the study. \"The distress or failure of one of the top three banks in a country, for example, could destabilize the country's entire financial system, in part because its activities may not easily be replaced by other institutions.\"\n",

      " Firebomb Rips Through DEA Office in Florida. A firebomb ripped through a recently opened Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Fort Myers, Fla., early yesterday, destroying files and causing morethan $4 million in damages in what investigators said may have been the work of local drug traf-fickers.The office was unoccupied at the time of the bombing, about 2 a.m., and no injuries were reported. But officials said the remains of the 6,000 square foot office building, located in a shopping mall, were still smoldering nearly 12 hours later.About 2 1/2 hours before the bombing, another incendiary device exploded between two automobiles in a residential section of Fort Myers about three to four miles away. No injuries were reported, but officials said they were investigating the possibility that the two incidents were connected.The office bombing was apparently the first ever against a DEA office in the United States, officials said. A team of agents from the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Lee County sheriff's office immediately began reviewing recent drug cases brought by the Fort Myers office to look for possible links to the bombing.Fernandes called the incident \"an act of desperation\" by drug dealers who he said may have been retaliating for recent cases brought by DEA agents in southwest Florida. \"It could be one of many individuals or groups of individuals,\" Fernandes said. \"If you look at the productivity of the Fort Myers office . . . they've been knocking them dead lately . . .

      " For New Milacron President Meyer, The Dollar's Loss May Be His Gain. CINCINNATI -- For such executives as Daniel J. Meyer, newly named president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the dollar's sharp plunge may bring opportunity.A lower dollar tends to help capital-goods makers like Milacron compete in world markets -- and it also generates business from certain U.S. manufacturers who themselves fare better in world competition. \"(The dollar's drop) may kill the stock market and cause all other kinds of havoc, but it will put us in a better competitive position in world markets,\" Mr. Meyer says optimistically.The trick at Cincinnati Milacron will be to transfer its present know-how in metal-parts manufacturing and factory automation into related businesses with world-wide growth. For Mr. Meyer, former executive vice president and chief financial officer, the assignment is to do it profitably.\"Putting a finance man in as president is a clear signal that the company will emphasize profitability,\" says Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc. \"The board wanted somebody less emotionally tied to operations to take a hard look at what costs can be eliminated.\"Mr. Meyer, an Indiana native who has worked for Milacron since 1969, says he has already begun a cost-cutting scrutiny. \"The whole cost structure is under review right now,\" he says. His promotion followed immediately after the company reported a $3.9 million loss for the third quarter, in contrast to a profit of $5 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.\n",

      " All Quiet on the Eastern Front?. The United States in recent months has been preoccupied with the Middle East and with the near-term crisis posed by North Korea's announcement that it has nuclear weapons. But there are other long- term developments taking place that will change the political landscape of Asia in ways that will ultimately weaken U.S. influence there. Policy makers in Washington seem scarcely to have noticed, much less arrived at a long-term strategy for dealing with these developments.Since 1945, East Asia has never had the internal cohesion or organization of Europe, with the latter's strong multilateral institutions like the European Union and NATO. But this is beginning to change. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) joined with the three major Northeast Asian powers, China, Japan and South Korea, to form a group called Asean Plus Three in 1998. In addition, the Chiang Mai Initiative links the central banks of 13 East Asian countries and provides swap facilities in case of speculative attacks of the sort that occurred during the financial crisis of 1997-98. At the Asean summit meeting in Vientiane, Laos, last December, the organization decided to hold an East Asian Summit some time next year in Kuala Lumpur that would bring together the leaders of the Asean Plus Three group, but not those of the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, or India.There is a great deal of irony in this development. In 1990, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohammed proposed the creation of an East Asian Economic Caucus, a multilateral grouping of East Asian powers that would deliberately exclude countries like the U.S. and Australia -- a \"caucus without the Caucasians.\" The U.S. and Australia were vehemently opposed to this. At American behest, the Japanese quietly sought to kill the idea, while the Australians worked hard to promote a more inclusive Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as an alternative. What Asean Plus Three and the proposed East Asian Summit represent is a resurrection of the old Mahathir proposal, but this time with mighty China rather than tiny Malaysia driving the process forward. Japan, which earlier had acted as America's cat's paw in stopping the Mahathir plan, is now on board.The roots of these developments lie in the Asian economic crisis, and in a series of highly effective Chinese diplomatic initiatives over the past several years. There has always been a huge gulf in perceptions about the causes and consequences of the Asian crisis between the U.S. and countries in East Asia. Americans tended to see the problem as one of crony capitalism, poor corporate governance, and flawed exchange rate management on the part of Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and other countries. The East Asians, by contrast, interpreted the behavior of the U.S. and U.S.-influenced international financial institutions like the IMF as narrowly self-interested, seeking to open up Asian financial markets to U.S. investment banks. To this day, South Koreans refer to the crisis of late 1997 as the \"IMF crisis.\"In the aftermath of the crisis, Washington continued to bat down proposals from the region for new institutions to mitigate future financial shocks, like the Japanese proposal for an Asian IMF. Since the Clinton administration had little to offer the region in terms of new ideas or institutions, countries there took matters into their own hands and established the Chiang Mai Initiative and Asean Plus Three. Things have gotten no better under the Bush administration, which has made the war on terrorism the lens through which it saw regional cooperation.\n",

Secretary Snyder promised good business for the next 12 months or so.But Comptroller of the Currency Preston Delano and Walter E.

The FX Global Call covers the main news events affecting foreign-exchange markets in Asian and European trading hours, as selected by DJ FX Trader editors in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other hot spots when warranted.1. The fallout from the Bank of Japan meeting continues. The yen traded above 97 to the dollar, its weakest in three years. The prospect of massive central bank bond-buying has sent Japanese Government Bond yields to all-time lows. Investors appear to be rotating out of Japanese debt and into Europe, Neelabh Chaturvedi reports. The yield on the benchmark 10-year French government bond fell 0.09 percentage point from Thursday's close to a record low of 1.79% while the corresponding Italian bond yield eased 0.09 percentage point to 4.48%, the lowest level since Feb. 25, according to Tradeweb.2. The yen may have another dramatic move in it today if monthly U.S. payroll data surprises the market. Economists have an average forecast for 200,000 jobs added in March, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 7.7%. If the numbers are good, it will further raise the odds of the Federal Reserve winding down its easing program, just as Japan is stepping on the gas.3. The Korean won and Malaysian ringgit continued their recent trends, with the won at its weakest in seven months against the dollar and the ringgit at its strongest in two months. Investors are selling the won as North Korean tensions rise, while the ringgit's strength is tied to the government's improving chances of surviving elections likely to be held at the end of April.4.

      " ECB Bucks Trend, Leaves Rates Alone --- Despite Hopes of a Cut, Central Bank Sees Risk Of Inflation in Europe. Persistent inflation risks kept the European Central Bank from trimming interest rates -- despite a slowing economy, intense political pressure and market expectations of a cut -- and the bank signaled that any reduction wouldn't necessarily come soon.\"I specifically don't want to introduce a bias in our public utterances or statements,\" ECB President Wim Duisenberg said at a news conference. \"So you keep on waiting and we keep on seeing.\"Mr. Duisenberg further brushed off pressure to cut by saying a series of seven rate increases up until last October resulted in \"the disappearance of inflationary risks over the medium term. But having achieved that does not mean that we have to also reverse the course.\"Rate cuts in the U.S. and Japan three weeks ago, coupled with a softer tone on inflation from some of the ECB's most influential officials, sparked speculation the ECB would trim at least a quarter point from its key rate of 4.75% at yesterday's meeting. Now economists believe the ECB will keep rates steady until May or even June, remaining the only major central bank to stand still in the face of the global slowdown. The ECB sets interest rates for the 12 nations using the euro -- the world's second-largest economy.The decision disappointed those investors who believe the ECB is sacrificing too much growth for low inflation. Within minutes of the ECB announcement, the euro fell a half cent to 88.4 U.S. cents. Two hours later, the common currency hit a low for the day of 88.1 cents. Late in New York trading, it was quoted at 88.75 cents, down from 88.81 cents late Tuesday.\n",

So much has been written by now that the issue itself seems to have grown stale, mired in tired rhetoric and unthinking assertion.On one side are the advocates of women, blacks, Hispanics, gays, the handicapped, veterans and others who have or seek protected status, and on the other tire those who find special treatment of any kind objectionable. The former insist that their rights will be trampled if affirmative action ends, while their critics complain that preferences based on such criteria as race, sex and national origin turn the meaning and purpose of the Civil Rights Act upside down. By now, we have many times heard the arguments from both sides, and there seems to lie no way out of the dilemma^ other than through the marshalling of political power to impose the views of one side on the other.Yet, the quagmire that this aspect of social policy is stuck in may be an artifact of the language of tire Civil Rights Act. The deadlock, I suggest, results from the manner in which civil rights protections are written, not from any lack of clarity about their purpose. Anyone who has read the testimony before Congress in 1963 and Ua64, and the speeches of the sponsors of the. Civil Rights Act, knows that the intent of Congress was to end invidious discrimination, whatever its source.In passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress specified that certain kinds of discrimination would henceforth be illegal. In the years since then, groups that wish to have the special protection of the law have clamored to be added to the official list of protected minorites. In practice, this has meant competition for preferences, even for quotas, in hiring and in admission to competitive schools.U Every institution should adopt a straightforward declaration of nondiscrimination without naming the specif ic groups that will not be discriminated against.\n",

      " Maryland Speaker Girds For Gambling Showdown; Busch Challenges Governor in First Major Test. Maryland House Speaker Michael E. Busch had a single question for a delegate who recently compared his crusade against slot machine gambling to the ancient tale of Horatius, the man credited with preventing the Etruscan army from conquering and pillaging Rome.Legend has it that Horatius single-handedly staved off attackers by defending a strategic bridge until it could be destroyed, then jumped into the Tiber River. But versions differ as to whether he reached safety and was duly rewarded by a grateful city or drowned before reaching the bank.In the modern world of state politics, Busch (D-Anne Arundel) is the chief obstacle to a proposal that would dramatically expand legalized gambling in Maryland. The affable new speaker has pitted his House of Delegates against Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R), who has made legalizing slot machines a centerpiece of his first year in office, and against Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., a Democrat and pro-slots veteran with a proven ability to manipulate the levers of power.In the coming days, Busch's political acumen will be put to the test. He will bring to the House floor a proposal to study the gambling issue for a year. He will settle on a package of tax increases and budget cuts to fill a gap estimated at more than $400 million. He will have to move those proposals through two key finance committees, where leaders would rather use slot machine revenue to backfill at least a portion of the shortfall. And then he will have to persuade a majority in the House to vote for the budget plan the following week.A plan to close corporate tax loopholes could raise about $200 million but would still require deep cuts to balance the budget. Two other options, raising the sales tax by a penny or temporarily increasing the income tax for top earners, would raise more money. But Ehrlich has promised to veto both, meaning delegates might be forced to take a politically difficult vote for naught.\n",

      " A Taxed Market Reopens. The market didn't crash. The 684-point fall doesn't even make history's top 10 percentage declines. And so we may conclude that if Congress now does the right thing quickly on tax policy, the market will rise.Problem is, the early indications we're getting is that Congress may enact a new tax bill using conventional means, such as tax credits, mainly to shore up the largest corporations. Incentives at the margin will be minimal. That is, half a loaf.The outlook would be considerably more worrisome had the market's indices spent the whole of yesterday in a steady, precipitous decline. The reality is that most of the day's 7.13% loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day.A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial. The economy before last week was already in the doldrums, with little upside evident so far from a series of interest rate cuts, or for that matter the tax rebate. Much of the airline industry has suffered for years from fixed union costs that leave little room for sustained profitability. The closure of the air transport system may have merely pitched several airlines toward inevitable dissolution, which would be reflected in yesterday's trading.That said, share prices generally rose in Europe, and Asia's losses were modest. It is a small miracle that trading in New York opened at all; most likely operations will smooth in the weeks and months ahead. Most importantly, all available evidence suggests that the men and women who make up the American economy are prepared to move heaven and earth to prove that their system will not be defeated by homicidal barbarism.\n",

      " Polish Economic Crisis Endangers Political, Social Reforms; Round-Table Talks Fall Short On Wages, Prices, Scarcities. Poland's worsening economic crisis is threatening to overwhelm the progress that communist authorities and opposition leaders here have been making toward the most significant political and social reforms in the Soviet Bloc.Although close to a series of sweeping political agreements, the two sides remain divided in their six-week-old talks on how to manage an economic crisis that both sides see as the chief threat to the new pact.Soaring inflation, mounting industrial unrest and the threat of a collapse of the domestic market were crucial factors in the decision of the communist leadership of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to open negotiations with the banned Solidarity labor union Feb. 6. Yet despite reaching accords on landmark reforms of Poland's political and social life, the two sides have made only meager progress during the talks on the question of how to halt the price spiral or restock nearly empty shop shelves.As a result, even as they celebrate breakthoughs they say they never expected to reach, politicians on both sides have been left with the uneasy feeling that their pact may be scorned by a society impatient for economic improvement yet condemned to even greater austerity.\"What will be decisive\" for the success of the round-table agreements, wrote senior opposition strategist Jacek Kuron this week, \"will be not the electoral card but the meat rationing card.\" Kuron added that \"the agreement could be broken because society completely rejects it on economic grounds.\"\n",

      " GOP Blames Tax for Drop in Million-Dollar Earners. The number of self-reported million-dollar earners in Maryland has dropped by roughly a third compared with this time last year, renewing debate yesterday about whether the state's year-old \"millionaires' tax\" is driving rich people beyond its borders.The data from April's tax filings, released by the comptroller's office, came with a couple of big caveats. At least part of the drop-off in Marylanders whose returns showed more than $1 million in taxable income was certainly due to the recession and the decline it has brought in earnings from capital gains and real estate. And the figures do not include taxpayers who filed for extensions.Still, the \"substantial decline\" in million-dollar earners filing on time was enough for the comptroller's office to announce that it will \"be thoroughly analyzing these returns and their implications.\" And it was enough for opponents of the state's new surcharge to say, in essence, \"I told you so.\" \"I don't think anyone can dispute that some people have left Maryland,\" said Senate Minority Leader Allan H. Kittleman (R-Howard). \"That's what we were trying to explain when we were voting on this.\"Among the skeptics, however, was Warren Descheneaux, the chief fiscal adviser to the legislature, which last year raised the state's top marginal tax rate, applied to income above $1 million, from 5.5 percent to 6.25 percent.The new rate, which is set to expire after three years, was expected to affect roughly 6,000 taxpayers, about 40 percent of whom reside in Montgomery County, based on the previous year's tax data.\n",

      " Fannie Mae Is Mounting a Major Assault On Abuses of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages. WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association is mounting a major assault on some abuses in adjustable-rate mortgages, which have fueled the recent housing recovery.With such mortgages, dubbed ARMs, monthly payments change periodically along with prevailing interest rates. Their lower initial rates have made homes available to millions of families in recent months. Roughly two million home buyers have taken out more than $120 billion in ARMs since 1981. Industry figures show that they accounted for more than 75% of the $13 billion in new home loans made in February.Fannie Mae is worried because certain ARMs, largely marketed in Texas, California and the Southeast, provide first-year interest rates far below those of fixed-rate mortgages but with little or no limit on increases in future mortgage payments. With such arrangements, \"consumers could be turned off on an instrument that's essential, and secondly, the issue could become politicized,\" warned David Maxwell, chairman of the government-sponsored, privately owned association, in an interview. Yet ARMs \"are the key to the long-term solvency of our financial institutions,\" he added.The association's crackdown is taking three forms: A call to the lending industry to police the problem ARMs, restrictions on the type of ARMs Fannie Mae buys and inauguration of a consumer-education program. Its efforts carry considerable clout; Fannie Mae, the nation's leading supplier of home mortgage funds, holds nearly $9 billion of ARMs in its $80 billion mortgage portfolio.Mr. Maxwell is expected to emphasize Fannie Mae's concerns in a speech today before the Texas Mortgage Bankers Association in Fort Worth. A line exists \"between helping home buyers fulfill their aspirations and encouraging them to borrow beyond their means,\" Mr. Maxwell's prepared remarks state. \"And we who care about the long-term health of the housing and mortgage industries should be the first to turn the spotlight on abuses in the marketplace.\"\n",

      " Letters to the Editor: A Balanced Approach to the Budget. The Oct. 9 editorial-page article \"Growth-Tamed Deficit Needn't Be an Illusion\" by A. Gary Shilling illustrates why we need a balanced approach to the deficit issue, instead of simply relying on some combination of economic growth and unspecified spending restraint. Aside from a host of very \"iffy\" but crucial assumptions regarding revenue growth, interest rates and inflation, Mr. Shilling's \"simple projections\" assume a great deal when he supposes that federal expenditures could be held to a 3% nominal rate of growth. On this, Mr. Shilling is presuming nothing short of a miracle.Last August, the Office of Management and Budget projected government outlays to support current obligations growing at about a 7 1/2% annual compound rate over the next five years. At the same time, the Congressional Budget Office put the rate at 9%. For the increase in nominal outlays to be held to 3% a year over the last half of this decade as Mr. Shilling suggests, roughly $100 billion would have to be pruned from the FY 1989 OMB spending figure (the year before Mr. Shilling's budget would balance!) and a more imposing figure close to $175 billion would have to be lopped off the CBO expenditure projection, even after allowing for his lower inflation rate.Although Mr. Shilling proposed \"not requiring any cuts in spending,\" the net result of his expenditure scenario has to be very substantial reductions in spending for current services and commitments. Unless this were to occur, the revenue stream could not come anywhere near the spending track in his time frame. Simply holding the dollar level of the budget at a constant and modest rate of increase ignores the fact that there are many commitments already in the budget, especially for defense, which would force Congress to cut other spending.Congress would find the depth and breadth of such reductions unacceptable politically. The only viable course for gaining control of the budget's bottom line is through a thoughtful combination of cutting defense spending, cutting domestic spending, raising revenues and encouraging economic growth. Only if all these are involved in reasonably equal proportions will it be possible to forge the needed political consensus.I am afraid that without a greater understanding and lobbying effort on the part of an informed public, the deficit problem may soon become the economy-endangering crisis that has so long been predicted.\n",

      " Jobs Data Provide Hope --- Market Rallies on Private-Sector Gains, Even as Unemployment Rate Ticks Up. The U.S. economy lost jobs for the third month in a row in August, but modest hiring by the private sector eased concerns the economy might be tumbling back into recession.Private-sector employers added 67,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said Friday. Overall, nonfarm payrolls fell by 54,000, as the U.S. shed 114,000 temporary Census workers and state governments also reduced employment.The jobs report was consistent with other recent economic reports, including a strong factory report earlier this week, that show the economy continues to recover, though at a painfully slow rate.The unemployment rate ticked up to 9.6% from 9.5% in July, not because of layoffs but because more people entered the work force. Some 14.9 million people remain jobless, and the unemployment figure marked the 16th straight month above 9%, the longest stretch in a quarter-century.That promised to keep the pressure on Democrats in Congress as midterm elections approach, with Republicans pressing the case that the party that dominates both Congress and the White House isn't getting Americans back to work.\n",

      " Jakarta's IMF Pact Permits Increase In Social Spending. JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The International Monetary Fund's revised pact with Indonesia to restart lending of $43 billion in assistance will allow Jakarta greater social spending and a budget deficit of 8.5% of gross domestic product for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.This deficit will be wholly financed by foreign borrowings and will, subsequently, require additional funds of at least $4 billion from outside sources, the IMF's top man in Jakarta, Hubert Neiss, said.But he stressed that these funds were urgently required to head off an economic \"emergency\" in the world's fourth-most-populous nation. \"Production and exports have been disrupted, unemployment is increasing, the banks are paralyzed, and food prices are rising,\" Mr. Neiss said. \"It's no wonder the rupiah rate has depreciated.\"Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hailed the new pact between Jakarta and suggested the U.S. will help Indonesia get the money it needs both from international financial institutions and other countries; he wasn't specific. The success of the IMF program, he added, depends on Indonesia's \"ability to sustain both economic and political reforms.\" Financial analysts voiced surprise at the economic assumptions under which the IMF and Indonesia calculated this latest pact. The rupiah is targeted to end the year at 10,000 against the U.S. dollar, substantially stronger than its Thursday close of 14,700. However, many currency analysts fear that the rupiah could weaken in the months ahead, given social and political concerns.All of this raises the possibility that Indonesia's budget deficit could actually exceed the target of 8.5% of GDP. The government will probably have only two options to cover a bigger deficit, analysts say: the seeking of even more international assistance or the restructuring of sovereign debt. Either way, one Jakarta-based diplomat said: \"It looks like we [the international community] will be asked to cough up again.\"\n",

      " Why You Should Consider a Shorter Mortgage Record --- Low Rates Spur a Switch To 15-Year Loans, a Good Place To Put Extra Cash in Down Market. WITH SOME MORTGAGE RATES at record lows, borrowers are starting to do something odd: They are agreeing to higher monthly payments.An increasing number of affluent homeowners are swapping traditional 30-year mortgages for 15-year loans, which carry monthly payments that can be hundreds of dollars a month higher. In return, however, they're getting the lowest 15-year loan rates on record, and a chance to pay off their mortgages by the time their kids go to college or they retire. On top of that, 15-year mortgages carry far lower interest expense over the life of the loan. The shorter time frame can save a borrower more than $100,000 in total interest payments on a $200,000 loan.The heightened interest in the shorter mortgages is yet another byproduct of the falling stock market. For homeowners capable of handling the higher monthly payments, the 15-year mortgages may present a more attractive use of extra cash than the market. In essence, they're choosing to pay off their debts rather than risking their money in the uncertain market or investing in low-yielding vehicles like savings accounts.A year ago, \"the last thing people wanted to do was pay more mortgage\" each month, says Michael Menatian, president of Sanborn Corp., a West Hartford, Conn., lender. But now, he says, that has completely changed. \"People are saying, `Where else am I going to put my money?' \" Mr. Menatian says about a fourth of his refinance clients are opting for 15-year mortgages, compared with 10% last year.It's easy to see why some borrowers might be tempted. Rates for a typical 15-year loan fell last week to a record low 5.93%, according to Freddie Mac. As recently as 1995, rates on 15-year loans were nearly 9.0%.\n",

THERE'S a parlor game that literary folk sometimes play: How many of the abundance of titles being produced by contemporary writers, they speculate, will be remembered 50 years from now?John Updike, Norman Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates, Gore Vidal, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth - if history is any guide, most of their words will fall away.

      " $4 Million Severance Elicits Outrage in France; In Response to Public Outcry, Government Vows to Reverse Payout to Head of Auto Parts Company. A wave of indignation swept over France when it became known Tuesday that the head of a large auto parts company who was edged out because of poor results walked away with a severance package worth more than $4 million.The outrage, which intensified government threats to pass a law limiting executive pay, reflected a growing sense of unease as the global financial crisis bites ever more deeply into the French economy, with unemployment surpassing 2 million and recrimination mounting against President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempt to remedy the situation by propping up ailing banks and businesses.As it has in the United States, the issue of stratospheric compensation packages for executives who were in charge when the crisis erupted has become a rallying cry for fired workers, labor unions and politicians. Many French people, like their U.S. counterparts, have complained they are being made to pay for the greed and heedlessness shown by political and business leaders who allowed world financial markets to spin out of control.Aware of the mounting resentment and its political implications, the government was quick to react when news spread that Thierry Morin, who left the Valeo company Monday, received a $4.1 million goodbye gift from the board of directors. The package was granted, the newspaper Liberation reported, even though the company lost more than $250 million last year, laid off about 1,600 employees in France and received nearly $25 million in government aid to weather the crisis.The budget minister, Eric Woerth, said it was \"provocative\" and \"abnormal\" for a struggling company that received aid from the government -- and in which the government has a minority interest -- to pay out such a generous severance package to someone who was let go over what were described as \"strategic differences\" with the board of directors.\n",

      " Have Financial Markets Broken From `Reality'? Many Economists Say Yes. With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever: Have the financial markets detached themselves from the \"real\" economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product?For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes. And they find it misguided to see the gyrations of the 1998 U.S. stock market as a reliable indicator of either a continued boom or an imminent bust.The stock decline is \"not telling us a thing about the U.S. economy,\" said James F. Smith Jr., professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. \"There's hardly anything wrong with the U.S. economy today that you can't solve with lower interest rates.\"It's tempting to believe otherwise, of course. It was less than eight weeks ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record 9337.97. Optimists saw it as proof of a new economic paradigm. Bolder types concluded, as they had in past years, that the business cycle had been repealed by tremendous strides in technology and productivity, justifying enormous leaps in stock prices.Today, just a few weeks later, doomsayers point to the plunging financial markets and the global damage inflicted by the Asian crisis.\n",

Immigrants from El Salvador and Mexico have come with less education and language skills and are taking lower-paying jobs, according to the Census data on economic, social and household characteristic of ethnic groups.\"Washington has a much more diverse set of immigrants compared to other cities in the country because the region offers many more types of jobs,\" said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.In New York and Los Angeles, family reunification has been a primary magnet for new immigrants. Though the Washington area has attracted immigrants with family connections, jobs associated with government contracting, the high-tech sector and rapid residential expansion have also drawn people, Frey said.The Census numbers include both immigrants and native-born members of various ethnic groups. The Indian population, which has increased by 50 percent in the past five years, has the highest median income of any group, at $87,369. That includes whites, other Asians and Hispanics, according to the Census data. About eight in 10 Indians in the region are foreign born; eight in 10 speak a language other than English, but eight in 10 also speak English very well.\n",

      " Economy Picking Up, Fed Says. The U.S. economy showed signs of faster growth in the past six weeks, including an increase in manufacturing, the Federal Reserve said in its survey of regional economies. Most of the Fed's 12 districts that were surveyed suggested stronger growth in their regions. \"Consistent with the generally more positive assessments of current economic activity, several districts noted increased optimism about economic prospects in coming months,\" the report said. Three districts -- Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco -- characterized economic activity as sluggish. Atlanta described business conditions as mixed. The Fed's report said that housing sales remained strong across various districts, helped by low mortgage rates.Pillowtex -- maker of Cannon, Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet towels, bed linens and other home furnishings -- closed its 16 plants, eliminated 6,450 jobs and filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. The company said it planned to wind down its business and dispose of its assets. Pillowtex had tried to find a buyer as a big debt-repayment deadline approached.Equifax agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve allegations that it did not do enough to answer calls from consumers inquiring about their credit reports. The Federal Trade Commission had accused the company of violating an earlier settlement with the agency that imposed performance standards. In settling, the company did not acknowledge breaking any law.Impath, a New York company that analyzes cancer tests for doctors, said it is investigating whether it improperly overstated money owed by customers and may report a loss this year. It said it will hire an independent lawyer and a forensic accountant to help with the investigation. It also said its vice president of finance and controller have resigned, but it declined to identify them; three other top executives have left in a little more than a year.Canada's economy expanded 0.1 percent in May. Car sales were good. Gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced, rose to an annualized $712.6 billion, Statistics Canada said in Ottawa. A drop in manufacturing tempered gains and signaled that the economy hasn't fully recovered from a 0.2 percent contraction in April.\n",

      " A Penny Saved . . .. Federal workers have seven working days to make what could be two of the key decisions of their careers: whether to join the thrift savings plan and where to invest the money. Joining the plan is a no-brainer. Just do it. Deciding where to invest takes more thought.For many young workers, the right long-term investment could mean a million extra dollars to spend in retirement. Experts say that savings plan accounts will produce half of the retirement income of workers covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.Employees who miss the Jan. 31 deadline to join the plan will have to wait until the end of the year for the next open season. That's a lot of investing time (and potential earnings) to lose. They can, however, move existing funds from one account to another every month.Feds don't need a session with Alan Greenspan to understand the thrift savings plan, but it can be confusing. Marjorie Mitchell, a Defense Department worker, would like a simple explanation of the funds. Here it is, along with each fund's track record since 1988: + Treasury fund. The G-fund has no risk, in the sense that it is guaranteed by the government. It is invested in Treasury securities with a guaranteed monthly rate. The problem is that the G-fund (or any investment, for that matter) may not generate enough income to allow the investor to keep well ahead of inflation. In 1988 and 1989, the G-fund returned 8.8 percent; 1990, 8.9 percent; 1991, 8.15 percent; 1992, 7.23 percent; 1993, 6.14 percent; 1994, 7.2 percent; 1995, 7.03 percent; and last year, 6.66 percent.+ Bond fund.

      " Pioneer Natural To Sell Portion Of Its Reserves. Pioneer Natural Resources Co. agreed to sell a portion of its future oil and natural-gas production to subsidiaries of Wachovia Corp. for $593 million, cashing in at today's high commodity prices.The Irving, Texas, energy company said it would sell about 20.5 million barrels of oil equivalent -- about half oil and half gas -- that it has discovered and slated for production over the next five to seven years. This is about 2% of the company's total reserves. Instead of selling the future production at market prices, the company sold an overriding royalty interest to Wachovia for a present value of $28.97 a barrel. Pioneer will book the sale as deferred revenue.Chairman and Chief Executive Scott D. Sheffield said the stock market placed a lower value on these future reserves than it was able to obtain through the deal. Pioneer was able to \"capture the arbitrage opportunity presented by the equity market's failure to appropriately value companies with longer-lived reserves,\" he says. Analysts, however, noted the move was tantamount to a bank loan, which uses future production as collateral.Pioneer's stock price rose on the news, up 6.2%, or $2.24, to $38.52 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.The announcement also overshadowed another announcement yesterday that the company is facing rising costs for finding and producing oil and gas through its drilling program. The so-called drill-bit finding and developing costs rose to more than $22 a barrel of oil equivalent. Facing these higher costs to drill oil and gas, the company said it will increase its spending on buying back its shares. The board approved spending $300 million in 2005 on share repurchases, up from $92 million last year.\n",

      " Runaway Inflation Runaway Inflation  . A VEHEMENT and portentous dispute over inflation is now under way, quite openly, within the administration. The issue is being forced by AmericansUa gradual comprehension of the enormous damage that prolonged inflation would inflict on our country. Over the past generation we have built strong and generally successful protections against high unemployment. But inflation, at the present extraordinary level, is an unfamiliar menace to Americans and in the highest councils of our government there is no agreement where it is going or how it can be controlled.It is 'conspicuous that, within the administration, the most optimistic views belong to those people who are &iot economistsUOfor example, President Nixon and White House aide Ronald Ziegler. In the spectrum of official opinion, the degree of pessimism seems to rise in proportion to intellectual stature and professional standing. One of the best-qualified students of the current inflation, Dr. John Dunlop, the director of the Cost of Living Council, has concluded that after a midyear dip the inflation rate will actually be rising by the end of the year. The most eminent economist in Washington is the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Arthur Burns, who is now invoking dire and dramatic terms to describe the costs to our society that a long inflation promises. It is worth noting the precise words that these men are using.The President sees, as usual, only sunshine ahead. Even before he came under the threat of impeachment, he had great difficulty delivering bad news and this failingUOa grave one in a national leaderUOis becoming more pronounced. UII am confident that we will experience further improvements in the economy during the remainder of this year.U he said in his radio speech last weekend. UIWe expect the inflation rate to be significantly lower than the rate we have experienced in the past 18 months.U In contrast, the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Herbert Stein, offers a far more cautious and somber forecast. The Council, in its midyear review published Tuesday, moved away from the precise numerical predictions of its Economic Report four months earlier, with its unqualified assurances of a decline in the inflation rate. Instead, the Council wrote, . a fall in the rate of inflation in the food and energy sectors will reduce the overall rate of inflation. significantly but will still leave a stubborn inflationary; process under way in the rest of the economy. ... The basic problem will be to prevent the slowing trend that does occur from being reversed . . Dr. Stein has been, over the years, a kind of cheerleader for the White House but he is, after all, a trained economist.Where Dr. Stein foresees the inflationary process UIunderway,U Dr. Dunlop expects UIan upturn in the general,rate of inflationU toward the end of the year. Dr. Burns, in a remarkable warning delivered a week ago, declared: UIThe gravity of our current inflationary probleqi can hardly be overestimated ... I do not believe I exaggerate in saying that the ultimate consequence of inflation could well be a significant decline of economic and political freedom for the American people.USince there is no agreement within the administration regarding the future course of the inflation, it is hardly surprising that there is also no agreement about the remedy. The President seems to think that we do not need much of a remedy, since he assumes that the food and oil shortages are over and things will get better by themselves. The number of people who believe that is getting steadily smaller. Suppose, instead, that we take the matter as seriously as Dr. Dunlop and Dr. Burns think we should. They do not have an easy good cheer to offer us. Both have been quite explicit about remedies, and their prescriptions all run to profound structural changes in the way that we regard money and spend itUOnot only as a government but as businesses and consumers. But structural reforms require a great deal of time.\n",

      " Signs of Hope for America's Cities. Presidential campaigns have a way of focusing on what is wrong and who is to blame. Now would be a good time to give some thought to an area where, in fact, considerable progress is being made: America's cities.For decades, talk about cities has been dominated by the perception of urban decay and by skepticism about urban policy. But the current reality paints a far more interesting -- and hopeful -- picture of metropolitan opportunity. In the past decade, the population of the nation's 50 largest cities has grown by nearly 10 percent. This was accompanied by a rise in city incomes that was almost double the national average and by an increase in housing units, homeownership and mortgage lending. In the same period, concentrated poverty declined 24 percent and urban crime also decreased.Cities are crucial to the U.S. economy. In 2002 metro economies were responsible for 85.6 percent of gross domestic product, almost $9.1 trillion in goods and services. If we look closely at inner cities, usually dismissed as lacking economic vitality, we understand that they, too, possess significant assets. Inner cities are home to 21 million people with purchasing power estimated at $331 billion. The business community is beginning to realize the potential of these communities, and investment has returned to many urban markets, bringing goods, services and job opportunities. What accounts for this progress? How can it be sustained, even accelerated, as we seek healthy cities worthy of the richest country on Earth?Several national trends -- such as immigration, population growth and the shift to a services-based economy -- are contributing to the urban renaissance. But another important factor is smart public policy. Over the past 20 years, bipartisan effort has put in place a number of federal programs that are working to stimulate private investment and energize people to take charge of their own destiny. They include the Home Investment Partnership Program, the Community Development Block Grant program, the new-markets tax credit and the earned-income tax credit. Their combined effect has been to help lift millions above the poverty line and into affordable homes.But two of the most important, one called HOPE VI and another known as Section 8 housing choice vouchers, were put in danger by reforms proposed in this year's budget. These are programs that have given cities important ways to transform aging public housing ghettos into dynamic mixed-income communities.\n",

      " Stelco Inc. to Reduce Dividend and Salaries, Cut Capital Spending. TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. said it will slash its quarterly dividend in half, cut salaries and reduce spending on capital projects as a result of the recession in its steel markets and the effects of a seven-week strike by the United Steelworkers of America.The Toronto steel manufacturer said it will cut its regular quarterly dividend payment to 12.5 Canadian cents (U.S. 10.8 cents) a share from 25 Canadian cents a share, the first such cut in nine years. The last time it cut its dividend, Stelco was also in the midst of a lengthy steelworkers' strike.Company officials said that the decision to cut the dividend, payable Nov. 1, could save Stelco about C$4.4 million (US$3.8 million). They declined to estimate savings from cutting salaries and capital spending.The company had planned to spend C$185 million on capital projects during 1990, a significant portion of which was accounted for by a project to reline one of its blast furnaces. That reline, begun July 1, has been halted by the strike, Stelco said.A spokesman for Stelco said salaries will be cut \"progressively\" as long as the strike continues. He declined to identify the size of the initial reductions.\n",

      " A Sarbanes-Oxley for Congress?. Every April 15 we ask: What is the government doing with my tax dollars?We know how much Congress spends, but to what end? The Department of Education received $67 billion in 2004, but do children read better? The government spends $30 billion on agriculture annually. Most of these subsidies go to the wealthiest farmers, including Ted Turner, making it our largest corporate welfare program. Was this the intent?Since 1993, the Government Performance and Results Act has required agencies to submit an annual performance report of goals and progress -- not unlike what shareholders expect from publicly traded companies -- an accounting of the agency's activities and financial condition. In spite of this law, some agencies still lag in transparently reporting on their goals and activities. According to the FY 2004 Annual Scorecard of agency performance reports (produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University), only 11% of the budget is covered by good reporting: The biggest agencies are still trying to articulate their goals and show public benefits, i.e. they don't know what results our dollars are delivering.We are all shareholders in the largest fiscal entity in the U.S.: the federal government. This year's proposed budget equals $2.57 trillion, a figure likely to increase when the final budget passes Congress. The majority, 55%, goes to entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. Discretionary activity consumes 37%, split evenly between defense and non-defense activities. The remaining 8% pays for interest on debt. Spending on entitlement programs will keep rising as baby boomers retire. And discretionary spending is also likely to creep ever higher. Without a change in budgetary behavior, spending as a share of GDP will rise to 40% by 2040. According to Comptroller General David Walker, balancing the budget in that year will require cutting spending by 60% or raising taxes to two-and-a- half times today's level.Before imagining the horror of that tax bill, or the political fallout of slashing swaths of federal programs, such measures may be unnecessary if the government starts allocating money according to program effectiveness, not political calculation. It's common sense (but not general practice in Congress) that the government should only spend money on activities that show results. This concept, also known as \"performance budgeting,\" has made inroads notably in President Bush's Management Agenda.\n",

      " Storm Cloud at the Global Bazaar?. Global finance is mysterious, exciting and sometimes reckless. A specter now haunts it -- the specter of excess \"liquidity.\" Will this prove a passing anxiety or, as in 1997 and 1998 with the Asian financial crisis, will it threaten the stability of the entire global economy? Good question.\"Liquidity\" is a common, but confusing, economic metaphor. Financial markets (say, stock and bond markets) are said to be \"liquid\" when it's easy to buy and sell. Transactions flow smoothly. By contrast, either buyers or sellers are scarce in an \"illiquid\" market. Prices move sharply, up or down. Markets can also have too much liquidity: Investors may take increasingly large risks to put their abundant funds to use. \"Bubbles\" can form. Losses may follow.Just recently, HSBC -- a major bank holding company -- announced more than $10 billion in losses on so-called \"subprime\" home mortgages. Representing about 20 percent of new mortgages in 2006, subprime loans go to weaker borrowers with shakier credit histories. When borrowers are less creditworthy, their loans carry higher interest rates. Hence, the appeal to lenders. Now, losses are emerging.What's unclear is whether the subprime losses are an isolated event or a harbinger of wider investment blunders.In the past quarter-century, points out economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley, the financial system -- the way that savings are channeled into investments -- has changed in three fundamental ways.\n",

      " Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / What's Hot...and Not: Investors Get Aggressive as Oil and Dollar Plunge; Hard Chargers Bet Big On Economic Recovery, More Woes for U.S. Dollar. A quirky mix of assets and markets world-wide has benefited from the simultaneous plunge of crude oil and the U.S. dollar, and strategists are pushing advice that hinges on the continuation of those trends.No surprise, other commodities besides oil have rallied on the dollar's woes, as have overseas investments, especially companies that produce or sell natural resources. The Dow Jones Japan Financial Index and Dow Jones World Basic Materials Index each gained more than 9% last week. Since November, the Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of shipping costs closely linked to raw-material prices, has jumped nearly 25% to 6134. Gold futures are up 6.6% over the same period to $457.80 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.But stock sectors usually associated with more-aggressive investment strategies, such as technology, have also benefited: The Dow Jones World Technology Index gained almost 8% last week. And the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.2%, up 8.8% since November, to 2147.96.The upshot, many analysts say, is that investors are betting not just on a continuation of world economic recovery and U.S. dollar weakness, but they are also doing so in especially hard-charging fashion. \"This is the theme right now, big time,\" says James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist, Wells Capital Management. \"People want to be in whatever the most aggressive thing is and get away from the least aggressive.\"Mr. Paulsen says he believes there is good reason to expect a global recovery, although a weak U.S. jobs report Friday showed that there may yet be a few potholes along the way. The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by only 112,000 jobs in November, well below the 200,000 jobs economists had expected before the data release.\n",

      " Nobels and National Greatness. In its proud and storied history, Hungary has produced a dozen winners of the Nobel Prize: four for chemistry; three for physics; three for medicine; one for economics; and one for literature. Not bad for a little country of not quite 10 million people.But one curious fact: All of Hungary's laureates ultimately left, or fled, the country. If you are brilliant, ambitious and Hungarian, better get out while you can.I've spent the past week reading up on the Nobels, mostly to relieve the gloom emanating from Congress, the White House, the State Department, the GOP caucus. It's paralysis time in D.C., and America-in-Decline time on the op-ed pages. Reflecting the global mood, Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, editorialized last week that, with a possible U.S. default on the horizon, \"it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world.\"But then there is the Nobel Prize, and the fact that Americans, both native-born and immigrants, took home nine of them this year alone. Note to Xinhua: China, with 1.3 billion people, has produced a grand total of nine winners in its entire history. Of those nine, seven live abroad, including three in the U.S. Another, Liu Xiaobo, sits in a Chinese prison.How is national greatness best judged? The typical view is that what matters is size: Size of the economy, population, landmass, navy, nuclear arsenal. Hence the hysteria that China may overtake the U.S. in terms of GDP sometime in the next decade. Hence the treatment of middling powers such as Russia (with a GDP roughly that of Italy's) as great powers.\n",

      " Markets Back in Lockstep as Risk Bets Return. Author: Mark GongloffJust when markets seemed headed back to normal, the \"risk on/risk off\" trade has come roaring back.Across financial markets, trading patterns more commonly seen in 2010 are returning. Stocks and the dollar are consistently moving in opposite directions, as are stocks and Treasury securities.It is a trading pattern that was common for much of 2010 as investors swung in and out of markets en masse-buying \"risk on\" investments like stocks when they felt brave, and \"risk off\" assets such as Treasurys and the dollar when they wanted safety.That pattern broke down earlier this year, in what some had seen as a return to normalcy. But the tensions in the Middle East and nuclear crisis in Japan have seen it return, frustrating investors who are seeking to trade on fundamental factors instead of headlines.

      " The Challenge of Inflation. During the campaign, Jimmy Carter spoke on practically every subject in. this world, and a few in the next. But notUOat least not in a systematic way-on inflation.The major speech prepared on inflation was never given, and an eight-point program based on the speech and' released on the campaign plane was almost universally ignored. So it is not surprising that businessmen are nervous and there is a tendency to see a collision shaping up between the President-elect and the sagacious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Arthur Burns.But in fact an analysis of the original speech shows that Carter takes the inflationary problem seriously indeed. It seems equally clear that Mr. Burns, far from seeking a shoot-out with the new administration, is moving toward a position of accommodation.The basic premise of the original speech prepared for Carter is that inflation is a deadly serious problem.

      " Sharing the Wealth: More Social Security Or Less? Clinton Plan Faces Lots of Questions --- But Stock-Market Proposal Opens Debate With GOP On a Key National Issue --- A New Kind of Savings Fund. WASHINGTON -- President Clinton made a bold opening bid in the Social Security debate, proposing to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in the stock market and to create government-sponsored, 401(k)-type individual savings plans for taxpayers.\"We must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth,\" the president said during his State of the Union address last night.The plan, offered in the face of a congressional effort to remove the president from office, drew immediate and harsh criticism from congressional Republicans. But by agreeing to channel Social Security funds into the stock market and advocating individual savings accounts, the president advanced a debate that promises to be one of the most provocative of 1999.For Wall Street, the stakes are huge. The Clinton plan and some congressional alternatives would channel between $650 billion and $1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars into stocks over the next 15 years. At the end of that time, White House officials said, the government would own 4% of the entire U.S. market. A number of Republican alternatives would channel as much money into the stock market, but would do it through individual accounts.The amounts being talked about are large but not overwhelming. An investment of $650 billion over 15 years would equal about $3.6 billion in new money a month. By comparison, individual investors have put $1.1 trillion into the stock market since 1991 through mutual funds, or about $11.5 billion a month, according to the Investment Company Institute. Since 1996, those mutual-fund inflows have averaged $17.1 billion a month.\n",

      " Milton Friedman vs. the Fed; The Nobel laureate would never have endorsed increasing inflation to stimulate the economy.. Author: Allan H. MeltzerWould the late Milton Friedman have endorsed the Federal Reserve's plan to make large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury bonds? The idea here is to pump more money into and thus jump-start the economy, reducing unemployment. Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program. I am certain he would not.Friedman's main message for central banks was to maintain a monetary rule that kept the growth of the money supply constant. In his Newsweek column, \"Inflation and Jobs\" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that \"unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,\" so that if a central bank \"cured\" unemployment by inflating, it \"will have unemployment later.\" In other words, don't try it.Friedman's Newsweek column for July 28, 1980 (\"Improving Monetary Policy\") came with the unemployment rate rising past 7%. His proposals for improving policy made no mention of using monetary expansion to reduce unemployment. He proposed rules for stable growth to achieve target \"dollar levels of monetary aggregates.\"Friedman served on President Reagan's economic policy advisory board. His memos on monetary policy repeat the themes he made familiar to Newsweek readers and others all over the world. There is not a word suggesting that monetary policy should try to raise the inflation rate in order to reduce the unemployment rate.\n",

      " Board of Contributors: Preventing a 1986 Recession. There is a significant risk that Congress will enact legislation this year that will push the economy into recession in 1986. The recovery is approaching its third anniversary and the 33-month average duration of all recoveries. And the statistical evidence leaves no doubt that the recovery has lost the vigor that characterized its first two years. Whether the economy will continue to expand or will slide into recession will depend on what Congress does about tax reform and deficit reduction.The easiest way for Congress to push the economy into recession next year would be to accept the administration's proposal to eliminate the investment tax credit on Jan. 1, 1986. Experience shows that the ITC provides a substantial boost to investment in business equipment. Eliminating the ITC would not only reduce the long-term level of investment spending but would have a particularly adverse effect on investment in 1986.If it looks as if the ITC is going to be eliminated next January, companies will bring forward to this year as much of their planned 1986 investment as possible in order to take advantage of the ITC while it is still available. When 1986 comes, investment would fall off very sharply, causing a decline in overall demand that could push the economy into recession.We will be particularly vulnerable in 1986 to such an adverse shock because, in addition to the natural weakness of a maturing recovery, the economy will be slowed next year by the short-term effects of deficit reduction. Although reducing the deficit will eventually make the economy stronger and healthier, the immediate effect of a cut in government spending will be to reduce demand. The government will spend less on a variety of goods and services, and recipients of transfer payments will have less to spend on consumer goods. The reduction in demand will mean less production and therefore less employment.Of course, the reduced deficit will also cause lower interest rates and a more competitive dollar and that in turn will increase investment and net exports. But experience shows that the response of investment and net exports to interest rates and the dollar occurs only with a lag of 12 to 18 months. The 1986 impact of the deficit-reduction legislation is therefore likely to be contractionary.\n",

      " The Tech World Gets Zapped; Local Innovators Are Paying Dearly For the Stock Market's Slump. Tom Blair, founder and chairman of United Payers and United Providers, a Rockville-based health care financing company, was just one day away from the company's initial public stock offering when his investment bankers delivered the bad news on July 1.With the market in a skid, you're not going to get as much as you want for your stock, the bankers bluntly told Blair and his partners. They gave them a choice: Postpone the offering for several months or cut the price.Instead of asking $13 a share for the stock as planned, the company cut the price to $11 and on July 2 sold 2.4 million shares. The offering raised $26 million in capital for the company, known as Up and Up, which helps insurance companies provide medical services at lower costs by prepaying hospitals. If the same number of shares had been sold at $13, Up and Up would have raised an additional $5 million, and could have raised even more if the stock had been issued for the $15 to $17 price projected when the issue was planned during the spring stock market boom.Whether it's called a correction, a sell-off or the beginning of the end of the longest bull market in history, this summer's stock market slump, which is hitting tech stocks particularly hard, is costing entrepreneurial Washington companies -- even if, like Up and Up, they are not in technology sectors -- millions of dollars.The Nasdaq Composite Index -- which consists of the stocks of many of the area's and the nation's fastest-growing companies -- closed at 1,096.68 Friday, down 12.2 percent from its peak this year of 1,249.14 on June 5.

Spending increased sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, helping to account for the strong rise in gross domestic product.Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. estimates business fixed investment in inflation-adjusted terms will soar 9.3% this year, a gain that the firm thinks will help spur the economy to a moderate rise.The consensus forecast is that inflation-adjusted GDP, the nation's output of goods and services, will grow 3.3% this year. Aside from capital outlays, the factors expected to keep the economy edging upward are residential construction, inventory increases and, to a modest extent, state and local government spending.The proposed temporary investment tax credit for large companies and the permanent one for smaller companies are under attack in Congress as tax loopholes that even industry doesn't want. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says the credits would merely move spending forward. Spending, in any case, is rising without them.In the latest Dun & Bradstreet survey of 5,000 manufacturing firms, 44% of all companies foresee increases in outlays during 1993. Another 17% expect to have lower expenditures, while the remaining 39% see outlays remaining constant at 1992 levels.\n",

      " Consumer Confidence Fell in September --- Index Drop of 10.7 Is Largest Since Post-Crash Period; Cause Termed Unclear. NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence fell sharply in September, the largest monthly decline since just after last October's stock-market crash.The Conference Board's confidence index dropped 10.7 points to 109 in September, compared with a revised 119.7 in August. The seasonally adjusted index uses 1985 as a base of 100. The September index was down 6.7 points from the year-earlier level of 115.7. In November 1987, a month after the crash, the index dropped 14.3 points to 100.8.\"It is still too early to say what may have shaken consumer confidence in September,\" said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. \"Although a single month's reading is inconclusive, the decline in confidence is too large and widespread to be dismissed as merely a technical aberration. The latest economic statistics, showing personal income rising only about half as fast as prices, may well have caused some consumer uneasiness. Still, the present confidence figure remains well above the level that generally signals recession.\"All sections of the country registered downturns in confidence about the present economic scene as well as expectations about the future situation in the Board's September survey, which is conducted by National Family Opinion Inc., Toledo, Ohio. The Conference Board is an industry-supported, nonprofit economic research group.\"One of the purposes of the consumer confidence survey is that it gives warning signals,\" Mr. Linden said. \"We're getting warning signals.\" The only positive thing about the latest survey, Mr. Linden said was that the index stood above a recession's \"historical trigger level\" of about 80. \"We're still well above a disaster level.\"\n",

      " Trade and the Honest Candidate. John Kerry may have surrounded himself with Clinton veterans, the technocrats who form the Democratic Party's permanent establishment. But the tone of his convention speech -- nationalistic not just on matters of defense but also on trade and economics -- marked a departure from the Clinton orthodoxy. Kerry attacked the outsourcing of jobs, which he implicitly blamed for a decline in manufacturing and in middle-class living standards. What does it mean, the candidate asked, \"when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up and shipped thousands of miles away, along with that job?\"Since Kerry asks this question, perhaps he will be good enough to provide voters with the answer next time he raises the subject.As Kerry and his advisers know, trade explains only part of the decline in manufacturing. Between 1970 and 2002, the sector's share of U.S. gross domestic product fell from 24 percent to 14 percent, a drop of 10 percentage points. But the trade deficit in manufactured goods grew by only about 4 percent of GDP over this period. Even though it's true that the deficit has recently grown sharply, deeper historical forces explain manufacturing's attrition.What forces? An honest candidate might highlight two. First, Americans are growing richer, and richer people tend to spend less of their money on manufactured goods and more on services. As a result, the composition of production tends to shift. Second, manufacturing productivity has risen fast -- considerably faster, in fact, than the average rate for the economy. That productivity gain explains why manufacturing jobs tend to pay well. But it also allows firms to meet consumers' limited demand with fewer workers, so that manufacturing employment has fallen even faster than manufacturing's share of GDP.So here's what Kerry ought to say. \"My fellow Americans, I promised in my convention speech to revitalize manufacturing. But this sector's long-term decline is the flip side of our economic progress. Our manufacturing workers are marvelously productive, which is why they are paid well and also why they aren't more numerous.\"\n",

      " Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Outside Audit: Puerto Rican Bank Woes Leave Tarnished Image; Doral Financial Disclosures Indicate, to Some Analysts, An Industry in Trouble. PUERTO RICO'S largest mortgage lender didn't answer all the questions about its books in a 195-page earnings restatement this week. It did say enough to convince some that the island's banking industry is in trouble.Some of the disclosures by Doral Financial Corp., which faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York, feed into a view held on Wall Street that several of Puerto Rico's banks are operated more like private clubs than public companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating Doral.In its restatement Monday, Doral said 2004 net income was $214.8 million, 56% lower than originally reported. The main culprit in the restatement: improper valuations on certain mortgage-related transactions.\"This is bad for everyone,\" Avi Barak, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill in New York, says about the effect on several other Puerto Rican banks. Mr. Barak doesn't cover Doral, but he has \"sell\" ratings on First BanCorp and R&G Financial Corp., two Puerto Rican lenders under investigation by the SEC for the way they accounted for mortgage deals with Doral.Specifically, Doral didn't put accurate values on some of the mortgage assets it sold to other banks. Those assets, called interest- only strips, or IOs, are likely to end up back on Doral's balance sheet after the other banks' auditors reclassify them as loans instead of sales, as required by generally accepted accounting principles.\n",

NEW YORK -- The dollar rebounded from a three-day rally in the yen after the Federal Reserve offered reassuring words on the U.S. economy, which calmed the frayed nerves of yen-funded carry-trade investors.The dollar had already started to reverse the three-day yen rally before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended, amid market expectations that the FOMC wouldn't make comments that could roil the markets.The FOMC didn't disappoint.

MOSCOW, Oct. 25UOThe Russian government has prepared its most ambitious anti-inflation program yet, a 1995 budget that would bring monthly inflation rates down to 1 percent but would also require unprecedented infusions of Western cash, Russian and Western officials said today.Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, renewing his commitment to tight-money policies in the wake of a disastrous ruble crash earlier this month, is scheduled to defend the budget plan before a skeptical parliament on Thursday. There is no assurance that the parliament will endorse it, no guarantee that the government will stick to its resolutions and no certainty that Western governments and organizations will come up with the billions Russia is counting on to make it work.But U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence H.

      " Bush Not Budging on Minimum Wage; Senate Democrats Scaling Back Plan in Attempt to Avert Veto. President Bush vowed to move \"not one penny\" beyond his proposal for a modest increase in the minimum wage yesterday as Senate Democrats planned to scale back their plan for a larger increase in hopes of reaching a compromise and avoiding a presidential veto.Bush's latest veto warning came as the Senate opened debate on the minimum-wage controversy, which is emerging as the first major domestic-policy showdown between the new Republican administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress.Bush proposes raising the hourly wage floor by 90 cents to $4.25 by Jan. 1, 1992, while letting employers pay newly hired workers the current minimum of $3.35 for six months under a new \"training wage.\"The bill introduced by Senate Democrats would raise the minimum by $1.30 to $4.65 by Oct. 1, 1991, without a subminimum for new workers. But Democrats agreed informally yesterday to reduce their plan in line with legislation approved last month by the House to raise the the pay floor to $4.55 over the same period, with a subminimum limited to a 60-day period for workers who have never been employed before. The Senate Democratic plan also calls for elimination of the subminimum rate a year after the final increase in the regular wage floor.Despite the modifications, the Democratic bill appears likely to run afoul of Bush's vow to veto anything that goes beyond his initial proposal. \"The president made it abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility-not one penny, not one deviation-in the training period,\" said House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) after a meeting between Bush and GOP lawmakers.\n",

Manufacturing workers in Japan, western Germany and Italy improved their productivity more in 1990 than U.S. workers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.Productivity increased by 3.7 percent in Japan, 3.4 percent in Germany and 3.2 percent in Italy, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States, the Labor Department agency said last week. The German figures refer only to the western part of the country, which was West Germany before unification.\"Productivity ... reflects the joint effects of many influences, including new technology, capital investment, capacity utilization, energy use and managerial skills, as well as the skills and efforts of the work force,\" the report explained.Actual output increased more in three other countries than in the United States: 5.1 percent in Germany, 4.5 percent in Japan and 1.1 percent in Italy. U.S. output rose by only 0.4 percent. The rise in U.S. productivity was due to the fact that the total number of manufacturing jobs decreased, so Americans worked fewer hours to produce more goods, the report said.Italians also worked fewer hours, although the number of jobs in the country increased. In Japan and Germany, the number of jobs and of hours both rose.\n",

      " A Growing Economy Can Pay Its Bills. The expanding army of homeless, the increasing filth of our streets, tightening educational and police protection budgets, and the snowballing real price of medical care, higher education, performing arts, legal services and insurance are all inescapable realities of life. Every industrial country suffers from these symptoms to some degree, but, as in other fields, they are still a few years behind us.What has gone wrong and what, if anything, can be done? While no single cause can account for these complex problems, one influence explains a good deal, and suggests the way out.Productivity stagnation in the service industries has led to persistent rises in their costs. The laggard services include, most notably, health care, education, legal services, welfare programs for the poor, postal service, police protection, sanitation, repair services, the performing arts and restaurants. Their common element is the handicraft character of their production, requiring large labor inputs that are resistant to curtailment.There are at least two reasons why rapid and persistent productivity growth has eluded these stagnant services. First, some of them are inherently hard to standardize. Before one can cure a patient or repair a broken piece of machinery, it is necessary to determine, case by case, just what is wrong, and the treatment must then be tailored to the individual case.A second reason why it has been difficult to reduce the labor content of these services is that in many of them quality is, or is believed to be, inescapably correlated with the amount of labor expended on them. Teachers who cut down the time they spend on their classes or who increase class size, doctors who speed up the examination of patients, or a police force that spends less time on the beat, are all held to be shortchanging those whom they serve.\n",

      " Choose: Guns or Butter. On Aug. 3, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent a message to Congress in which he said that the United States could not continue to fight a war in Vietnam and at the same time continue his Great Society programs without, among other things, raising taxes. George Bush ought to read that message. It was titled \"The Hard and Inescapable Facts.\"For Bush, facts are neither hard nor inescapable. He believes in \"magical math\" -- a firm understanding that somehow, in some way, something will happen to make everything come out right in the end. This is the economics practiced by the dreamy who think that today's credit card purchase will never come due. This, in a nutshell, is the financial blueprint for the United States of America.For Johnson, the realization that bills come due came too late. Early on he said, \"We can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam,\" but he sensed -- canny pol that he was -- that the American people would pay for the former but not, if they had to choose, the latter. When Johnson finally had to ask for a tax increase, he was on his way out as president. Less than a year after delivering his message about hard facts, he had to face the hardest one himself: He announced he would not seek reelection.Bush, having won a second term, cannot seek reelection and so he may never become politically accountable for his mismanagement of the nation's finances. As Johnson initially attempted, Bush is telling the American people they can have both guns and butter -- two for the price of one. In Bush's case, \"guns\" is the war in Iraq (and Afghanistan) and the \"butter\" is domestic programs such as enriched Medicare along with the war on terrorism, which Bush himself has characterized as virtually endless. In his case, though, he has not only refused to raise taxes, he has actually lowered them. LBJ could only marvel.Ever since the war in Iraq went from resplendent victory (\"Mission Accomplished\") to the ugly quagmire it has become (almost 2,000 American dead), commentators have been making comparisons to Vietnam. I myself have done that -- and I think certain commonalities exist and are troublesome. Usually, these comparisons focus on military or political matters, but Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state and now a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, has found what may be a more apt comparison. Initially, both wars were financed on the cheap because interest rates were low.\n",

      " Separation of Stocks and Stock. The most arresting part of President Clinton's State of the Union message was his proposal to shore up the Social Security system. The president is correct in focusing on this challenge.In 1950 there were 16 taxpaying workers for every retired person in the U.S. Today there are just over three workers per retiree, and the ratio is expected to fall below two during the next century. If Social Security benefits are to be maintained under present arrangements, substantial tax increases will be required on workers and companies -- a burden that will discourage employment. Alternatively, other government receipts will be required or large government deficits will reappear. Small wonder that Mr. Clinton has searched for a magic bullet that might painlessly avoid the hard choices.There are two parts to the president's proposal. The first is to preserve the budget surplus and allocate a substantial proportion to the trust fund. The second is to shore up the system by investing $700 billion from the trust fund in the stock market over the next 15 years. Presumably by investing in stocks that historically have produced returns considerably above the yield on long-term Treasury bonds, the trust fund would grow more rapidly, and the date when the fund would run out of money would be pushed out much later in the century.Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest part of the trust fund in equities is the more radical part of his plan. It is a bad idea with unpredictable and probably damaging consequences. Moreover, simply investing a part of the trust fund in stocks will not provide the extra resources to spare us from making hard choices during the next century.Having the government invest in private securities runs against the principles of free markets and could well interfere with the efficiency of the capital-allocation process. While the government would undoubtedly propose that the funds be given to an independent or private agency that would invest in a very broad equity index of perhaps thousands of securities, such a plan would necessarily increase the allocation of capital to larger companies at the expense of very small entrepreneurial concerns that lack the liquidity to accommodate large government purchases. Many of these smaller start-up companies are responsible for important productivity improvements.\n",

      " Last month's U.S. deficit broke the record for April. The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the federal deficit for April soared to $82.7 billion, the largest imbalance for that month on record. That was significantly higher than last year's April deficit of $20 billion and above the $30 billion deficit that private-sector economists had expected.The government generally runs surpluses in April, as millions of taxpayers file their income tax returns. But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps. The final third reflects added government spending on the $787 billion stimulus bill and the $700 billion financial bailout.\n",

      " Money Supply To Lose More Of Its Profile --- End of In-Person Briefings By Fed Signals Drop In Report's Importance. NEW YORK -- The U.S. money-supply report will take yet another step into the shadows this summer.Beginning sometime around the first of August, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will start to phase out its weekly, in-person news briefing, where it has given out the weekly money-supply data for decades.

      " Lower Mortgage Rates Lure Homeowners To Trade Up to Bigger and Fancier Houses. \"Move-up\" buyers are moving back into the housing market.As the high interest rates that long locked them in their old homes eased this spring, homeowners who want bigger or fancier dwellings became a major factor in real-estate sales. It has been five years since such buyers have been in the market so deeply, experts say, and the trend appears likely to persist -- fueled by pent-up demand among affluent baby boomers and stable mortgage rates.\"We're clearly past the bulge as far as the . . . first-time buyer being the dominant element in housing,\" says Weston Edwards, a senior executive vice president of Lomas & Nettleson, the nation's biggest mortgage banker. Now, he says, \"we're beginning to see their move-up process.\"The return of move-up buyers could reshape the housing industry. Their moves will increase the supply of more modest homes for sale, which could depress their prices. To meet demand for higher-priced homes, builders may shift away from their emphasis on small starter houses. In wealthier suburbs, housing experts expect builders to construct more expensive, custom-built homes. And since people buying higher-priced homes tend to also want lots of amenities, the building-supply industry hopes to benefit too.The presence of these buyers is showing up in the robust figures on new- and existing-home sales. In May, for example, newhome sales rose 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted 676,000-unit annual pace, a level expected to continue throughout 1985. Builders in Ohio, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere report heightened demand for their costlier homes or plans to expand pricey subdivisions.\n",

Lucas Jr., a professor at the University of Chicago whose economic theories give the common man much more influence on economic policy than central planners once had, won this year's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said yesterday that they awarded the prize to the 58-year-old economist for his \"insights into the difficulties of using economic policy to control the economy.\" The Academy called Prof. Lucas \"the economist who has had the greatest influence on macroeconomic research since 1970.\" Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole.Building on ideas first developed by another economist in the 1960s, Prof. Lucas formed what came to be called a theory of \"rational expectations.\" Today, his theories underlie economic and business planning throughout much of the modern world.In essence, the \"rational expectations\" theory shows how expectations about the future influence the economic decisions made by individuals, households and companies.Using complex mathematical models, Prof. Lucas showed statistically that the average individual would anticipate -- and thus could easily undermine -- the impact of a government's economic policy.\n",

      " Clinton Hails Bulgaria's Gains; Thousands Cheer as President Lauds Ex- Soviet Satellite's Democratic Efforts. On a packed square where Bulgarians celebrated the end of their Stalinist government a decade ago, President Clinton praised this Eastern European nation today for turning its eyes and ambitions to the West. He promised more help from the United States if Bulgaria continues its movement toward democracy and a reliable economic system.As several thousand people cheered and waved flags in the broad square before the Nevski Cathedral, with a full moon just starting to rise, Clinton hailed Bulgaria for throwing off communism and holding fair elections, even as he acknowledged the path has been bumpy.\"Communist rulers . . . fed you lies, yet you sought the truth,\" he said. \"When the Cold War ended, it took much longer for the ground here to thaw.\"Bulgaria, like Romania, has found it difficult to evolve from life as a Soviet satellite, suffering crippling inflation and unstable governments until 1997, when Petar Stoyanov was elected president and the economy began to find its feet. Clinton spent a busy day here not only to encourage that transition but also to draw a distinction between Bulgaria and its neighbor, Yugoslavia.While many Bulgarians disapproved of the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict, Stoyanov's government did not openly condemn the NATO campaign. Clinton, the first U.S. president to visit this country, returned the favor today. Standing next to Stoyanov, he told the crowd, \"you stood with NATO\" when the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, threatened the promise of an \"undivided, democratic\" Europe.\n",

      " Corporations' Orders to Buy Push Up Dollar --- An Early Slump Followed Yeutter Trade Remark; No Fed Action Is Seen. The dollar firmed yesterday, bouncing back from an overnight drop that occurred after U.S. trade envoy Clayton Yeutter gave a somewhat bearish outlook for the U.S. trade deficit.Traders said one or more large corporate buy orders contributed to the dollar's recovery from its intraday lows. The corporate orders reportedly prompted many dealers to buy more dollars to cover short, or oversold, positions in the U.S. currency.The sudden rise in the dollar's value during New York trading stirred rumors that the Federal Reserve had intervened on behalf of the U.S. currency. But traders at many commercial banks with which the Fed regularly deals said they saw no intervention by the central bank yesterday.\"The activity we saw was purely the result of speculative and corporate activity,\" Ian M. Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.Traders said the dollar's big lift of the day came when one or more large corporate orders to buy as much as $300 million were worked into the market by a couple of big New York banks. \"The dollar just shot up,\" said Mary Anne T.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced the 16000 mark but failed to finish above that level as investors paused to weigh the stock market's recent sharp gains.The blue-chip index closed up 14.32 points, or 0.1%, at 15976.02, after rising as high as 16030.28 in intraday trading. The Dow still ended at a record and has risen in six of the last seven sessions.The S&P 500 index was off 6.65 points, or 0.4%, at 1791.53, reversing an intraday gain that sent the index above 1802. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 36.90 points, or 0.9%, to 3949.07.Stocks spent the bulk of the session in positive territory before shedding much of their gains in the final hour of trading. Traders attributed the move to comments by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who told a conference sponsored by Reuters that he was \"very cautious\" on the stock market and could see a \"big drop\" because earnings at many companies have been juiced by low borrowing costs rather than strong management, according to the news agency.Traders said the remarks were enough to shake investor sentiment on a day when trading volumes were thin and few other headlines were driving the market.\n",

      " Search for Compromise Elusive In Legislative Price-Fixing War; Consumer Groups, Discounters See Abuses Rising. The bombardment of conflicting lobbyist language, legal jargon, political punditry and editorial ink surrounding the battle over the proposed Consumer Protection Against Price-Fixing Act of 1991 is enough to confuse and confound even the most stalwart shopper.The legislation, moving through Congress, is designed to strengthen the laws against vertical price-fixing, which occurs when manufacturers and retailers conspire to fix retail prices to drive competition from the marketplace.That's been illegal for decades, but consumer advocacy groups and discounters claim that recent Supreme Court decisions and lack of enforcement by federal agencies have seriously weakened the antitrust laws and allowed price-fixing abuses to flourish in the marketplace.Consumer advocacy groups say this is a fight over the ability of retailers to buy products from manufacturers and sell them for any price. In other words, cheap sneakers.Manufacturers, full-price retailers and some business organizations beg to differ, claiming that off-price retailers are stronger than ever these days. If legislation giving discounters even more clout passes, they say, it will ultimately mean the end of traditional retailers that provide service, selection and quality guarantees to consumers.\n",

      " Raising the Roof on Riskier Lending; 'Subprime' Mortgage Practices by Banks and Finance Firms Draw Federal, State Scrutiny. The mortgage broker called out of the blue a year ago, but Jaquetta Patrick liked what he was selling.The 62-year-old retired secretary for the D.C. school system, who is legally blind, recalls that he said he could get her a much better deal than the $56,000, 15-year, 10.99 percent loan she had at the time. He said he could get her an interest rate under 7 percent and told her to stop paying her mortgage because he would take care of that until the new loan came through, according to court papers.Several months and a confusing array of mortgage brokers later, the District resident ended up with a 30-year loan for $65,800 carrying a rate that varies from 11.49 percent to 18.49 percent. When she asked why the rate was so much higher than what she had been paying, she says, she was told it was because she had a bad credit record, brought on by her failure to pay her mortgage for the past three months--as the broker had instructed.Patrick says she signed the papers for the new loan out of fear she would lose her house. \"They have danced me around so much I don't even know who's who anymore,\" she said. \"I'm devastated.\"There's an uneasy revolution going in consumer finance--subprime lending. Over the past five years many banks have rushed headlong into this market, defined as extending credit to consumers whose troubled credit histories make them a higher risk. The lure, despite the higher risk, has been potentially higher profit margins than lending to top-notch, prime credits, said Thomas Abruzzo, bank analyst at FitchIBCA, a credit-rating agency headquartered in New York.\n",

      " Small stock focus: Nasdaq to start trading all stocks in sixteenths. The Nasdaq Stock Market, the nation's second-largest stock market after the New York Stock Exchange in market capitalization, expects to start allowing all of its stocks to be traded in 1/16-point increments starting Monday.The change, while expected, is a milestone in the evolution of the markets -- and may, at least theoretically, lead to better prices for small investors.The Securities and Exchange Commission's market-regulation division Tuesday evening approved the rule proposal, which Nasdaq submitted to the federal regulator April 10. The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has so far steadfastly stuck to quoting in 1/8-point increments, though many market observers expect that will have to change once its competitors switch to sixteenths.Currently, when Nasdaq dealers move their stock prices up or down, they change them in minimum \"ticks\" of 1/8 of a point, or 12.5 cents at a time. Thus far, only quotes for stocks that are priced at $10 or under are moved up or down in smaller increments, some as low as 1/32, or 3.125 cents.Lowering the tick size for all Nasdaq stocks to 1/16 of a dollar, or 6.25 cents a share, could improve prices for individuals who will have the chance to buy for less or sell for more when investing in Nasdaq stocks -- from the market's giants like Intel and Microsoft, to the thousands of tiny stocks on the market. The reason is that \"spreads\" between the best possible price at which an investor can buy a stock and the price at which they can sell are likely to shrink.\n",

      " Two-cents plane: Free airline miles become a potent tool for selling everything. AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalThe JNF was the first charity to buy American Airlines frequent-flier miles and offer donors one mile for every dollar contributed. Donors, by a ratio of 10 to 1, opted for miles over other incentives, including T-shirts and mugs. \"Everyone's a mileage junkie,\" says Stuart Paskow, a fund-raising consultant for the JNF, which helps develop land in Israel.Frequent-flier miles, dreamed up by American 15 years ago to sell airline tickets, have burgeoned into a national addiction -- and a significant new source of income that could help tide airlines over future recessions. The metamorphosis of mileage programs, to include charities and all manner of earth-bound goods and services, is giving airlines new influence in selling stuff having nothing to do with aviation.First, there were \"travel partners,\" such as hotels, car rentals and credit cards. Now, carriers are selling miles at two cents apiece to any company -- large or small -- that wants to offer them as sales incentives. Frequent-flier miles are available from lawn services, mortgage firms, investment houses, restaurants, furniture stores and roofing companies. ABC, the television network now owned by Walt Disney Co., is studying ways to offer miles for watching TV shows.Alert consumers can get twice the miles, or more, by using mileage-awarding credit cards when patronizing mileage-awarding merchants. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, which has the largest frequent-flier program, says 1,000 companies now buy its AAdvantage miles under an \"incentive miles\" scheme begun 17 months ago. American sold an estimated $300 million in miles last year -- $25 million of that through incentive miles, according to Randy Petersen, the publisher of InsideFlyer magazine. Though the company won't confirm the estimates, it does say that incentive miles sales should more than double this year.\n",

      " Spanish Lessons: Mexico Might Learn From Fall of the Peso In Chile Last Decade --- The Pain Was Deep, but It Transformed the Nation Into a Global Exporter --- Prerogatives of the Dictator. SANTIAGO, Chile -- From the construction cranes dotting the skyline to the modernist paintings decorating the subway, this capital has a thriving air that seems more characteristic of a Scandinavian country than a Latin American one.But Chileans won't easily forget the steep price of today's prosperity: the great currency collapse of 1982.The implosion of the Chilean peso -- which declined more than 90% in 12 months -- followed an ill-fated effort by a group of U.S.-trained economic officials to peg the currency to the dollar. In the ensuing crisis, one-quarter of Chilean workers lost their jobs, wages regressed to levels not seen in a decade, and soup kitchens provided the only sustenance for millions of the impoverished. Within the depression, however, lay the seeds of Chile's current boom. Forced to look outward for new markets, Chilean companies turned into dynamic exporters, which today sell chopsticks to Japan, wine to Europe and machinery to the U.S.Chile's success in transforming a currency bust into an export bonanza underscores a widely overlooked silver lining in the recent Mexican peso crisis: The almost 35% devaluation of the peso could significantly accelerate Mexico's evolution as an export power, a process that was well under way when the country joined the North American Free Trade Agreement. But along with offering hope for Mexico, the story of Chile's painful comeback from devaluation also contains a warning: Mexico will discover that sacrificing near-term domestic wealth for long-term international competitiveness places severe strain on the nation's social fabric.\"If Mexico's devaluation is to benefit its exports, Mexico must do what Chile did: avoid an inflationary spiral,\" says Sebastian Edwards, chief economist for Latin America at the World Bank. \"That requires sacrifice.\"\n",

      " Airport Woes and Trust Fund's 'Surpluses'. There is a deepening suspicion among air travelers that the delays and frustrations they are experiencing at busy airports are the result of a conspiracy -- a conspiracy hatched in Washington. Rumors abound that the government is diverting funds earmarked for better aviation to reduce the deficit. That the Federal Airport and Airways Trust Fund has an uncommitted balance of $5.6 billion is often cited as proof that something fishy is going on.In truth, however, this uncommitted balance, or \"surplus,\" is not a surplus at all. It is an optical illusion created by focusing on the trust fund and not on total spending for federal aviation.The trust fund was created to finance capital improvements at the nation's airports, to modernize the computers, radars and other equipment used by air traffic controllers, and to defray part of the costs of operating and maintaining the air traffic control system. It also was designed so that those who enjoy the benefits of modern air travel would be the ones to pay, rather than the general taxpayer. Accordingly, the fund's revenues come from an 8% tax on airline tickets, taxes on aviation fuels, and interest earned on cash in the fund.Understandably, aviation users, who have steadily been paying taxes into the trust fund, would like to know why it has a large and growing uncommitted balance. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not because the administration has been hoarding the money in an attempt to reduce the federal deficit. In fact, fiscal 1987 aviation user taxes of $3.2 billion were less than estimated spending of $5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, thereby increasing the federal deficit by $1.8 billion. The trust-fund balance has grown because Congress has forced the government to use general fund revenues -- including personal income taxes -- to pay for aviation programs, instead of allowing money to be spent out of the trust as intended.Congress created this situation by putting \"penalty provisions\" into the 1982 law that authorized the trust fund. First, Congress limited the amount of money that could be paid out of the trust fund to a percentage of funding for airport improvement. Thus, only about 71% of FAA costs could be paid for out of the trust fund, even though several studies have shown that those paying into the fund account for about 85% of that agency's costs. Then, Congress reduced that even further by tying trust-fund spending for operational costs, such as air traffic controllers, to the amount of money spent each year for capital-improvement programs, such as replacing outdated computers.\n",

OUaNeill, S&P president and chief rating officer, in the July 1 issue of Creditweek. Ten years ago, the median was UA.Ua U That contrast goes to the heart of the problem that has affected the quality of corporate bond issues in recent years and will for some time. The heavy issuance of debt by corporations during the 1980s created a situation in which the corporations had to service this debtUOthat is, pay the semiannual interestUOand pay back the principal at maturity.Servicing the debt comes mainly from earnings and, for some companies, from the sale of assets. Some issuers of debt, especially retailers with below-investment-grade ratings Gunk bonds), became so extended that it was thought a virtual impossibility that they could service their debt when they issued their bonds in the late 1980s.As the country slipped into the 1990 recession, many issuers who were marginal credits at best ran into problems paying their debt interest as their earnings fell.Consider a hypothetical example of a company with $100 million in debt outstanding, at an interest cost of 10 percent per year, or $10 million. In normal times, letUas suppose that our company had $20 million available for interest or fixed-charge payments. A credit rating analyst would say that the interest coverage was $2 of earnings for every $1 of interest, and with that kind of coverage, an UIAUaUa rating would probably be assigned to the company.In the mid-1980s, our company became aggressive and added another $75 million of debt at the same interest rate. Assuming no increase in revenue, our company must now pay $17.5 million a year in interest, and the fixed-charge coverage falls to $1.14 for each dollar of interest owed. The rating agency would lower the credit rating to BBB.\n",

According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of EEOC data, there were 1.2 black female professionals for every black male professional in 1982. Now, there are 1.8. Though white women have made substantial gains relative to white men, white men continue to have a greater share of professional jobs: In 1982 there were 0.62 white women professionals for every white man; in 1992, there were 0.94.Black women also are making strides in the more general category of \"white collar, excluding clerical.\" In 1982, there were slightly more black women than black men in that category. By 1992, the number of black women in those jobs had grown 90% to about 815,000, while the number of men had grown less than 50%, to about 564,000.That black women are rising more rapidly than black men in corporate America is a source of mixed feelings for blacks. Considering the obstacles to promotion that minorities of all kinds often face, the success of black women professionals is reason for pride.\n",

      " Buying Real Estate Without Cash Isn't a Sure Thing for Investors. . .. \"Make Money Without Money.\" \"Learn How You Can Create Wealth.\" \"Buy Real Estate at Below Market Value With No Money Down.\"For most people, the appeal is almost irresistible: Using only borrowed money, buy properties from desperate sellers on extremely favorable terms; refinance, sell or rent them and make a killing; parlay the profits into a real-estate empire.During the hyperinflationary 1970s, the strategy worked for some shrewd investors, and on occasion it still does. But slower rises in property values, a dearth of desperate sellers and an abundance of unrealistic techniques have rendered the strategy far from a sure thing.In fact, for the vast majority of hopeful practitioners, no-money-down ownership is often an unattainable, but costly, dream. The money they spend on how-to seminars, books and tapes will constitute their only big-time real estate investment. \"It's the same kind of thing you see with all these diet books that are being sold,\" says Norman Stettner, a Houston real estate investor. \"Do you actually see people getting skinnier?\"Those investors who do manage to buy no-money-down properties run the risk of getting trapped in negative cash-flow situations created by poor market conditions and lower inflation. Hettie Kirkpatrick, for example, says she pays more in mortgages than she makes in rents on six properties she bought in the depressed Houston market. \"The hard part hasn't been buying houses for no money down,\" says Ms. Kirkpatrick. \"The toughest thing is keeping them after you buy.\"\n",

      " Monti Says Europe Growth Policy Crucial. ROME--Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is putting his country through tough spending cuts to escape Europe's debt crisis, warned that European leaders must take concrete steps to fuel the Continent's economic growth or risk threatening its long-term future.\"Europe will not be a nice place to be in five years from now if we haven't solved the problem of how to grow,\" Mr. Monti said in an interview before heading to the U.S. for talks with President Barack Obama.\"We have to say what growth will look like in a fiscally compacted union,\" said Mr. Monti, referring to the new \"fiscal compact\" Europe's leaders agreed to last month to ensure greater budget discipline in the euro zone.The comments by Mr. Monti, a 68-year-old economics professor who heads a government of national unity aimed at steering Italy out of the euro-zone crisis, underscore a growing belief among policy makers here that the Continent needs to slowly start moving beyond austerity packages and figure out how to prevent the Continent from falling into years of stagnation.Europe still has big fires to put out, namely coming up with a fresh bailout for Greece and ensuring that Italy and Spain take credible steps to rein in their public spending. But economists say structural economic changes across the Continent are just as important to Europe's long-term prosperity as is fiscal discipline. Euro-zone gross domestic product is expected to fall by 0.5% this year and to rise by a meager 0.8% next year, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n",

      " Action Plan for the IMF. Anyone who questions whether we are living in a global economy needs to reflect carefully on the financial turmoil of the past few weeks. We can no longer escape the issue of how to manage in a world in which economic currents have no frontiers but our instruments to deal with them do.The International Monetary Fund lies at the center of this storm. It is the only financial institution that has some semblance of global influence. The IMF, however, is the subject of considerable controversy. The traditional approach of the IMF is to lay the foundation for healthy economic growth by restraining government intervention in the economies, ensuring sound currencies and encouraging open markets. Its policies have been a major factor in spurring unprecedented changes in the global economy.Current efforts to stabilize the Asian economies, however, are far different and more complex. Gone is the luxury of an exuberant economic environment. Commodity prices are plummeting. Interest rates in the affected countries are soaring, crippling banks and bankrupting business. Manufacturing plants throughout Asia have idle excess capacity. Unemployment is rising sharply. Devaluations and the fall of capital markets have drained substantial liquidity from global markets. The losses on the U.S. stock market alone since July are equivalent to the total annual GDP of all of the Latin American nations combined. Governments cannot balance budgets in the face of collapsing tax receipts, impeding their capacity to stimulate their economies.The problem for the IMF, however, is that the issue of corruption that got us into this predicament is just as real. As we see in Russia and many countries of Asia, this is the most pernicious contagion that has infected many banks and commercial enterprises. The result has been illicit enrichment and misallocation of resources, which taxpayers the world over are now being asked to pay. This will not do.The deep concerns about corruption reflected in the debate in Congress about IMF funding have to be addressed in formulating new policies. On the positive side, strong U.S. and European economies still exert considerable pull to lift the faltering economies of the developing world. The countries of Asia are now yielding large current-account surpluses, which could help them restore their economies if they have access to bridge capital. The issue is how to restore global confidence while not abetting corrupt practices or rewarding ill-considered lending.\n",

      " Market Crash Course. Everyone knows what happens to a fool and his fortune. In John Rothchild's case, however, the process was particularly brutal.He dove into the financial markets with $16,500 and casual dreams of being wealthy. Eighteen months later, the Dow had soared, but Rothchild's original stake had been shaved all the way down to $800. He couldn't have lost much more if he'd been trying.This neat trick wasn't accomplished solo. Rothchild sought help from stockbrokers, commodities traders, interest-rates guru Henry Kaufman, risk arbitrageurs, short-sellers, financial planners, stock analysts and the trash cans of insider trading whiz Ivan Boesky. Almost always, Rothchild found his advisers as befuddled as himself. And if they didn't think that, they were soon confounded anyway.\"People say the market's this or the market's that, and they begin to think they can understand it,\" a corn trader on the Chicago Board of Trade told Rothchild. \"They discover they're wrong. They can't understand it. The market is ... the market is God.\"Don't feel too bad for Rothchild, though. At least he gained a book out of his ordeal. (It's called, of course, A Fool and His Money.) Subtitled The Odyssey of an Average Investor, the book seeks to demystify the experts by pointing out the pitfalls of investing in general and mindless investing in particular. It's an idea that's getting a sympathetic reception in the wake of the market's October plunge.\n",

      " Letters to the Editor: Scranton Going Broke? You've Got It Wrong. Your Jan. 21 editorial characterized the city of Scranton, Pa., as near bankruptcy. I want to present a more complete picture. Scranton is in fact in the midst of an economic boom that is unique in this time of recession. We are building a $101 million mall in our downtown area and are developing a $65 million national park based on our heritage of the steam engine, railroads and the coal industry.In addition, our three hospitals and the University of Scranton are expanding to the tune of $80 million. Other development projects add $35 million, for a total of $281 million in a city of 81,000 people. Does this sound like hard times?Even The Wall Street Journal has recognized Scranton as the \"new hot city for industry.\" Money magazine has referred to our city as one of the \"best places to live in America.\"We have applied to the state for assistance to wipe out a $5.5 million deficit created largely by an outside arbitrator who awarded $4 million to the firefighters union because officials from a previous administration did not attend an arbitration meeting. I believe we could have eliminated the deficit ourselves through hard work and refinancing of our own assets. However, the City Council felt differently and sought help from the state, and I accept its decision. I have not raised taxes in my two years in office, and I will cooperate with the state as long as it helps us without raising our taxes.One of my concerns in involving Scranton in the Distressed Municipality Act was that national media such as your paper would confuse this with a declaration of bankruptcy and mislead the rest of the nation as to the economic well-being of our community. That is exactly what has happened.\n",

      " Trade Gap Widened by 15% in September --- As U.S. Economic Growth Outpaces Rest of World, Exporters Feel a Pinch. WASHINGTON -- The trade deficit exploded to a record in September, as Americans continued to soak up imported goods and U.S. exporters were hurt by damped economic growth overseas.The gap between exports and imports hit $34.3 billion, almost 13% wider than economists had expected for the month and 15% larger than the revised $29.8 billion deficit posted in August, the Commerce Department reported.The result of weaker exports is slower overall growth in the U.S., with economists now estimating that gross domestic product rose at a 2% annualized rate in the third quarter of the year, not the 2.7% the government previously had calculated. That would be the slowest growth rate since the U.S. economy limped ahead 0.8% in the second quarter of 1995.Nonetheless, the U.S. economy grew at an estimated 5.2% rate for the year ended Sept. 30. And even the reduced third-quarter pace in the U.S. is stronger and more consistent than the growth rates of its big overseas business partners. European growth has slowed recently, while Japan's perennially sluggish economy still hasn't gotten much traction.\"You have U.S. growth continuing to outpace the rest of the world,\" said Gerald D.

To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million.
